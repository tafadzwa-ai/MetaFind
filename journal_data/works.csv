41041664,Cholesterol metabolic reprogramming drives the onset of DLBCL and represents a promising therapeutic target.,"Cholesterol is an essential molecule for tumor cell growth and proliferation, and dysregulated cholesterol metabolism has been widely implicated in cancer pathogenesis. However, the specific role and underlying molecular mechanisms of cholesterol metabolism alterations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remain poorly understood. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 200 DLBCL patients and 185 healthy controls, focusing on lipid and lipoprotein levels, including triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the prognostic value of these markers, and Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed their associations with overall survival (OS). Bioinformatics analysis predicted associations between lipid markers and cholesterol metabolism. Cellular experiments further investigated the expression of cholesterol metabolism-related proteins and the effect of the cholesterol-depleting agent Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) on DLBCL cells. We confirmed significant alterations in metabolic markers (such as TC and ApoA1) between the healthy control group and patients, which were significantly associated with patient prognosis and overall OS. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a strong correlation between these markers and elevated CD36 expression. In addition, DLBCL cells exhibited increased expression of cholesterol uptake and synthesis proteins (CD36, SREBP2, and HMGCR) and decreased expression of efflux proteins (APOA1, NR1H2 and ABCG1), consistent with cholesterol metabolic reprogramming. Treatment with MβCD disrupted CD36 expression and cholesterol metabolism, leading to reduced DLBCL cell survival. These findings underscore the pivotal role of cholesterol metabolic reprogramming in DLBCL progression. CD36 and related metabolic markers represent promising therapeutic targets, opening novel avenues for the treatment of this malignancy.",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2025
41041663,Oxygen concentration modulates HDAC1-Mediated regulation of osteogenic signaling pathways in dental pulp cells.,"Dental pulp regeneration represents a critical frontier in translational dentistry, with dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) demonstrating exceptional reparative potential through their multipotent differentiation capacity. While oxygen tension is known to influence cellular physiology, its regulatory mechanisms on DPSC osteo/odontogenic differentiation remain poorly understood. We established physiologically relevant oxygen gradients (3%, 5%, 21% O<sub>2</sub>) to mimic developmental and pathological pulp microenvironments. Cellular proliferation and osteogenic capacity were assessed through flow cytometry, CCK-8 assays, and Live/Dead staining. Differentiation markers (RUNX2, OCN, ALP, DSPP) were quantified via qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, and enzymatic activity assays. Pharmacological inhibition studies using Oltipraz (HIF-1α inhibitor) and Valproic acid (HDAC inhibitor) elucidated pathway interactions. Publicly available transcriptomic datasets were analyzed to identify hypoxia-regulated pathways, and protein interactions were predicted using bioinformatics tools. Moderate hypoxia (5% O<sub>2</sub>) significantly enhanced DPSC proliferation (p < 0.05 vs. normoxia) and upregulated osteogenic markers at transcriptional (1.8-3.2 fold) and translational levels. Severe hypoxia (3% O<sub>2</sub>) suppressed both proliferation (p < 0.01) and differentiation markers (0.4-0.7 fold). HIF-1α inhibition reversed 5% O<sub>2</sub>-mediated osteogenic enhancement (p < 0.01), while HDAC1 blockade with Valproic acid rescued differentiation capacity under 3% O<sub>2</sub> (1.5-2.1 fold induction). Mechanistically, HDAC1 appeared to influence HIF-1α protein levels in an oxygen-dependent manner, and its inhibition affected pathways consistent with alterations in chromatin remodeling, influencing VEGFA-mediated osteogenic signaling. Our findings establish an oxygen-sensitive HDAC/HIF-1α regulatory axis governing DPSC fate determination. The biphasic response to hypoxia gradients suggests microenvironmental optimization strategies could enhance pulp regenerative outcomes. These insights provide mechanistic foundations for developing HDAC-targeted approaches in endodontic regeneration.",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2025
41041634,"The role of α-hydroxybutyrate in modulating sepsis progression: identification of key targets and biomarkers through multi-database data mining, machine learning, and unsupervised clustering.","Sepsis remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Recent studies suggest that gut microbiota-derived metabolites, such as α-hydroxybutyrate (α-HB), may play a critical role in the progression of sepsis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying α-HB's involvement in sepsis remain unclear. This study aims to explore the targets of α-HB and their association with sepsis progression using multi-database data mining, machine learning, and unsupervised clustering analyses. α-HB-related targets were identified through comprehensive data mining from three databases: SEA, SuperPred, and SwissTargetPrediction. Sepsis-related targets were obtained from the GEO dataset GSE26440, and the intersection of these datasets was analyzed to reveal common targets. Functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and machine learning algorithms (L1-LASSO, RF, and SVM) were applied to identify biomarkers. Additionally, a nomogram was constructed to predict sepsis progression. Clustering, GSVA, and ssGSEA analyses were performed to explore sepsis subtypes. Molecular docking simulations was conducted to investigate interactions between α-HB and key targets. A total of 42 common targets were identified between α-HB and sepsis, with significant enrichment in pathways related to immune response, hypoxia, and cancer. Machine learning-based feature selection identified four robust biomarkers (APEX1, CTSD, SLC40A1, PIK3CB) associated with sepsis. The constructed nomogram demonstrated high predictive accuracy for sepsis risk. Unsupervised clustering revealed two distinct α-HB-related sepsis subtypes with differential immune cell infiltration patterns and pathway activities, particularly involving immune and inflammatory pathways. Subtype 1 was predominantly associated with non-survivors, while Subtype 2 was more frequent among survivors, showing a significant difference in survival status. Molecular docking analysis further indicated potential interactions between α-HB and key targets (APEX1, CTSD, SLC40A1, PIK3CB), providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of α-HB in sepsis. This study identifies key α-HB-related targets and biomarkers for sepsis, offering new insights into its pathophysiology. The findings highlight the potential of α-HB in modulating immune responses and suggest that α-HB-related targets could serve as promising therapeutic targets for sepsis management.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2025
41041587,Genome-wide characterization and expression analysis of the GATA transcription factor family in response to salt and drought stress in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.).,"GATA transcription factors play a crucial role in regulating plant growth and development as well as stress responses. However, systematic analysis of <i>GATA</i> genes in barley remains uncharacterized, and their functional roles in salt and drought stress responses are poorly understood. This study conducted genome-wide identification and gene expression analysis of the GATA transcription factor family in barley through bioinformatics approaches. A total of 27 <i>HvGATA</i> genes were identified and divided into 4 subfamilies (I-IV), which were unevenly distributed on 7 chromosomes. Overall tertiary structural similarity of GATA proteins existed with differences, but similarity within the same subfamily was higher. Fragment repetition has been identified as the main driving factor for the expansion of the <i>HvGATA</i> family. Members of the same subfamily exhibit highly conserved exon-intron structures and motif compositions, indicating strong functional conservation among subfamilies. <i>Cis</i>-element analysis of the <i>HvGATA</i> promoter reveals potential regulatory complexity and enrichment of stress-responsive elements related to hormone signals (such as abscisic acid) and drought stress responses. qRT-PCR analysis showed that at 6 h after salt treatment, <i>HvGATA1</i>, <i>HvGATA19</i>, and <i>HvGATA25</i>, were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05). Under drought treatment, at least three <i>HvGATA</i> genes (<i>HvGATA1</i>, <i>HvGATA19</i>, and <i>HvGATA25</i>) showed dynamic expression patterns, which were down-regulated and up-regulated at 2 h, 24 h, and 12 h, respectively, indicating that they have potential roles in regulating salt tolerance and drought tolerance of barley. This research provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of salt and drought tolerance in barley and offers potential targets for enhancing the crop's stress resistance under abiotic stresses.",Frontiers in plant science,2025
41041339,Integrating bioinformatics and experimental validation to reveal a novel VRK score as a prognostic and therapeutic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Vaccinia-related kinase (VRK) family genes play a multifunctional role in tumor development. However, the role of VRK family genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires further research. Moreover, the clinical potential of the VRK-related model remains unclear. The aim of this study is to construct a VRK-related model to predict HCC prognosis and therapeutic efficacy. The data of HCC patients were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm was used to calculate the VRK score of each sample. Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource 2.0 (TIMER 2.0) and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) were used to evaluate immune cell infiltration and the immune checkpoint response. pRRophetic was used for predicting drug sensitivity. CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, transwell and xenograft assays were used to experimentally validate the biofunction of VRK2 in HCC. We found that all VRK family genes were highly expressed in HCC. Compared with patients with low VRK scores, patients with high VRK1 or VRK2 expression in the TCGA, ICGC, and GSE14520 cohorts had poorer outcomes. Moreover, patients with a high VRK score in the TCGA, ICGC, and GSE14520 cohorts also had poorer outcomes. Importantly, Cox analysis revealed that the VRK score was a potential independent risk factor for HCC. Notably, TIMER2.0 and TIDE suggested that patients with high VRK scores had higher immune checkpoint response rates. Similarly, drug sensitivity analyses suggested that patients with high VRK scores were more resistant to sorafenib, paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine. Finally, experimental validation revealed that VRK2 knockdown inhibited HCC development <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The VRK score was found to be a reliable indicator for predicting HCC prognosis and therapeutic efficacy. VRK2 is a potential therapeutic target for HCC.",Frontiers in immunology,2025
41041279,Comprehensive Analysis of DGATs and PLINs in Ovarian Cancer: Implications for Diagnosis and Prognosis.,"Lipid droplet (LD) dynamics drive cancer cell proliferation, resistance, and aggressiveness. Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferases (DGATs) and perilipins (PLINs) are key LD-associated genes implicated in cancer pathophysiology. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the expression and clinical significance of DGATs and PLINs in ovarian cancer (OC), focusing on their correlation with LDs and triglyceride (TG) levels, and to explore their diagnostic and prognostic implications. LD and TG levels in ovarian cell lines and clinical samples were assessed using BODIPY staining, fluorometric, colorimetric assays, and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Gene expression profiling of DGATs and PLINs in cell lines and tissue was conducted via RT-qPCR, ELISA, and bioinformatics analysis. Correlation analyses between gene expression, Ki67, and survival data were performed. ROC curve analysis evaluated diagnostic potential. LD accumulation was significantly higher in OC cell lines and tissues compared with normal controls. Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) were overexpressed in OC cell lines and tissues, particularly in advanced stages (III and IV). Elevated TG levels were observed in OC cell lines and clinical samples, correlating with LD abundance and the expression of DGAT1 and DGAT2. PLIN2 and PLIN3 were significantly upregulated in OC tissues. Bioinformatics analysis identified dysregulation of DGATs and PLINs in OC. Survival analysis indicated DGAT2 is a predictor of poor prognosis. Diagnostic assessments revealed DGAT2 as a potential biomarker for OC detection. DGATs and PLINs are pivotal in LD metabolism and tumor progression in OC, with DGAT2 being a good candidate as prognostic and diagnostic marker. They present promising avenues for therapeutic targeting and diagnostic biomarkers, holding the potential to improve patient outcomes. Further exploration of their mechanistic roles and clinical implications is essential for advancing personalized cancer care.",BioMed research international,2025
41041146,Nuclear trafficking of <i>Anelloviridae</i> capsid protein ORF1 reflects modular evolution of subcellular targeting signals.,"<i>Anelloviridae</i> members are ubiquitous viruses with a small, negative sense, single-stranded DNA genome which is replicated by host cell DNA polymerases. Anelloviruses are postulated to interact with the host cell nuclear transport machinery, however, the lack of reliable cell culture models strongly limits our knowledge regarding <i>Anelloviridae</i>-host interactions. In particular, capsid nuclear import is a largely uncharacterized process. We addressed this by investigating the relationship between host cell nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) and ORF1, the putative capsid protein from torque teno douroucouli virus (TTDoV). We identified the subcellular targeting signals and NTRs responsible for its nucleolar and nuclear localization, and characterized their relative contribution to ORF1 subcellular localization. In the absence of other viral proteins, ORF1 accumulated in the nucleoli. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a putative classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS) within the highly conserved N-terminal arginine rich motif (ARM) ('NLSn', 27-RRWRRRPRRRRRPYRRRPYRRYGRRRKVRRR-57), and an additional C-terminal cNLS ('NLSc', 632-LPPPEKRARWGF-643), which has been specifically acquired by <i>Anelloviridae</i> capsids with larger projection domains. Such NLSs play distinct roles in ORF1 subcellular localization by interacting with specific NTRs. NLSn, a non-classical NLS, features broad importin (IMP) binding affinity yet plays a minor role in nuclear import, being responsible for nucleolar targeting likely through interaction with nucleolar components. NLSc, a <i>bona fide</i> cNLS, specifically interacts with IMPα and is the main driver of active nuclear transport in an IMPα/β1-dependent fashion. These findings suggest an evolutionary correlation between the acquisition of progressively larger projection domains and the presence of additional cNLSs in <i>Anelloviridae</i> capsids, aimed at maximizing IMPα/β1-mediated nuclear import.",Virus evolution,2025
41040873,Diversity and distribution of amino acid decarboxylase enzymes in the human gut bacteria-a bioinformatics investigation.,"Biogenic amines play numerous biological functions that include neuromodulation, maintenance of the gut health and motility, gastric acid secretion, regulation of immune response, cell growth, and gene expression. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehend the potential modulation of these molecules by the human gut microbiota. A primary pathway for the generation of these molecules involves the decarboxylation of amino acids, a process facilitated by enzymes known as amino acid decarboxylases (AADCs). Here, we conducted a bioinformatic analysis to understand diversity and prevalence of AADCs from the most prevalent members of the human gut microbiome. This study aims to understand how human gut microbes generate metabolites that influence health and disease, through specific enzyme activities. Our results indicate that AADCs are most abundant in the prominent gut microbial genera, namely <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i>, <i>Alistipes</i>, and <i>Enterococcus</i>. Within these, <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> harbors the most variety of amino acid decarboxylases, potentially playing an important role in driving decarboxylation chemistry in the human gut. Furthermore, among AADCs, arginine decarboxylases are the most common, present in approximately 60% of the frequently found members of the human gut microbiome, followed by aspartate 1-decarboxylases and glutamate decarboxylases. In addition, our sequence analyses of various AADCs demonstrated that a tetrad of amino acids in the PLP binding motif can provide functional identification for AADCs. We hypothesize that the diversity in AADCs and the microbes that harbor them has the potential to alter host metabolic outputs. This could provide a mechanism to use specific changes in microbial genera or species to understand possible metabolite modulations that might influence biological functions. Such studies could lay the groundwork for developing future disease markers or therapeutic interventions.",Frontiers in microbiology,2025

41040664,Panoramic analysis of the biological function and clinical value of SLC38A2 in human cancers: a study based on pan-cancer and single-cell analysis.,"Glutamine metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of tumor progression and is highly correlated with poor clinical outcomes. The excessive uptake of glutamine by tumor cells is a key factor contributing to widespread invasion, metastasis, and immune suppression. SLC38A2, an amino acid transporter widely expressed on the surface of tumor cells, has not been thoroughly studied regarding its function and prognostic significance in tumor progression. Our objective is to employ bioinformatics methods to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of SLC38A2 across various cancers, aiming to elucidate its role and prognostic value in tumor biology. By comprehensively incorporating gene expression and clinical data from the TCGA tumor database, GTEx database, Human Protein Atlas, and GEO database, we analyzed the expression profile, mutations, and established prognostic models for SLC38A2 across various cancers. Additionally, we investigated the enrichment of SLC38A2 at the single-cell level in 12 types of cancer and analyzed its temporal expression patterns in different cell subgroups in breast and pancreatic cancer. We also studied the correlation between SLC38A2 and glutathione metabolism. Compared to normal tissues, SLC38A2 exhibits significant differential expression in 15 types of cancer and serves as a prognostic risk factor in BRCA (HR = 1.597, <i>p</i> < 0.05), LUAD (HR = 1.650, <i>p</i> < 0.01), MESO (HR = 2.007, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and PAAD (HR = 1.761, <i>p</i> < 0.05), while acting as a protective factor in KIRC (HR = 0.625, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, SLC38A2 is positively correlated with tumor and stromal cells, negatively correlated with immune cell infiltration, and associated with immune exhaustion. In BRCA, SLC38A2 is highly expressed during early differentiation of malignant and stromal cells, and enriched in late differentiation of immune cells. Moreover, the expression of SLC38A2 shows a general positive correlation with glutathione metabolism genes in BRCA, LUAD, MESO, and PAAD, demonstrating diagnostic value. SLC38A2 shows widespread changes in expression patterns within tumor tissues, making it an effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. It is enriched in malignant cells and tumor-infiltrating stromal cells, while negatively correlated with the infiltration of many cells involved in anti-tumor immunity. Targeting SLC38A2 presents a viable therapeutic strategy by inhibiting glutamine competition and relieving immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment.",Frontiers in genetics,2025
41040660,BioSemAF-BiLSTM: a protein sequence feature extraction framework based on semantic and evolutionary information.,"S-sulfenylation is a critical post-translational modification that plays an important role in regulating protein function, redox signaling, and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Accurate identification of S-sulfenylation sites is essential for understanding its biological significance and relevance to disease. However, the exclusive detection of S-sulfenylation sites through experimental methods remains challenging, as these approaches are often time-consuming and costly. Motivated by this issue, the present work proposed a deep learning-based computational framework, named BioSemAF-BiLSTM, which integrated evolutionary and semantic features to improve the prediction performance of S-sulfenylation sites. The framework employed fastText to generate subword-based sequence embeddings that captured local contextual information, and employed position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) to extract evolutionary conservation features. Importantly, we also quantitatively evaluated feature sufficiency at the protein sequence level using a sequence compression-based measure approximating Kolmogorov complexity, revealing an 11% information loss rate in predictive modeling using these features. These representations were subsequently fed into a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to model long-range dependencies, and were further refined via an adaptive feature fusion module to enhance feature interaction. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrated that the model significantly outperformed conventional machine learning methods and current state-of-the-art deep learning approaches, achieving an accuracy of 89.32% on an independent test. It demonstrated improved sensitivity and specificity, effectively bridging the gap between bioinformatics and deep learning, and offered a robust computational tool for predicting post-translational modification sites.",Frontiers in genetics,2025
41040659,Bioinformatics-based identification of differentially expressed genes in endometrial carcinoma: implications for early diagnosis and prognostic stratification.,"This study aims to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in endometrial carcinoma (EC) through bioinformatics analysis and investigate their roles in early diagnosis and prognosis. EC-related gene datasets were retrieved from the NCBI and analyzed using R packages to screen for DEGs. Primers were designed for selected DEGs, and their expression levels were validated via qPCR. Logistic regression, survival analysis, Cox proportional hazards models, and random forest models were employed to evaluate associations between DEGs and clinical outcomes. Bioinformatics analysis identified significantly upregulated genes (<i>Erb-B2</i>, <i>PIK3CA</i>, <i>CCND1</i>, <i>VEGF</i>, <i>KIT</i>) and downregulated genes (<i>PTEN</i>, <i>E-cadherin</i>, <i>p53</i>). Logistic regression revealed <i>Erb-B2</i> as a protective factor against poor prognosis, whereas <i>E-cadherin</i> and <i>P53</i> were risk genes. Clinical markers CA125, CA199, and IL-9 also emerged as prognostic risk factors. Survival analysis demonstrated significant divergence between good and poor prognosis groups (<i>P</i> < 0.05), with HR < 1 for <i>Erb-B2</i> and <i>p53</i> (protective effects) and HR > 1 for <i>E-cadherin</i>, CA125, CA199, and IL-9 (risk effects). The random forest model highlighted CA199 as a pivotal prognostic biomarker, while decision tree analysis enabled effective patient stratification based on CA125 and CA199 thresholds. The identified DEGs and clinical indicators hold significant potential for improving early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation in EC. These findings provide novel biomarkers and theoretical foundations for precision medicine, guiding risk stratification and personalized therapeutic strategies.",Frontiers in genetics,2025
41040657,Uncovering differential gene expression between mtRNA-positive and -negative osteosarcoma cells: implications beyond mitochondrial function.,"Long-term clinical outcomes for patients with osteosarcoma have shown little improvement over the past few decades. Identifying novel molecular targets to inhibit osteosarcoma cell growth remains an urgent challenge. Explore the function of mtRNA in the occurrence and development of osteosarcoma utilizing bioinformatics analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) microarray dataset. The Network Analyst tool was used to analyze GSE73120. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using GEO2R and analyzed using NetworkAnalyst. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were performed using Metascape and WebGestalt. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed through the STRING database and visualized with Cytoscape. The MCODE algorithm was used to identify key modules, and CytoHubba was applied to determine hub genes. Validation of hub genes was conducted using the GEPIA database. A total of 104 DEGs were identified, including 89 upregulated and 15 downregulated genes. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that these DEGs were enriched in pathways related to connective tissue development, collagen trimer, and extracellular matrix structural components. The PPI network analysis identified seven hub genes. Among them, COL1A1, PDGFRB, and SPARC were confirmed as sarcoma-related genes using the GEPIA database. Our findings suggest that COL1A1, PDGFRB, and SPARC may be involved in mtRNA-driven tumorigenesis and could serve as promising therapeutic targets for osteosarcoma.",Frontiers in genetics,2025
41040270,Inferring Dynamic Information from Protein Structures by Gaussian Integrals and Deep Learning.,"Protein conformational flexibility underlies a wide range of biological functions, yet experimentally probing dynamics at atomic resolution remains costly and low-throughput. Here, we present a deep learning framework that predicts protein flexibility directly from static structural descriptors, bypassing the need for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Using the ATLAS database of standardized all-atom MD trajectories, we encoded 1,374 protein chains as 30-dimensional Gaussian integral (GI) vectors-global shape and topology invariants of the protein backbone. Principal component analysis of GI profiles revealed four structural clusters with distinct secondary structure compositions and flexibility distributions. We trained an attention-based one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to classify proteins as flexible or non-flexible based on their root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) relative to the dataset-wide mean. The classifier achieved an AUC of 0.772 (95% CI: 0.712-0.826) on an independent test set, with balanced sensitivity and specificity, and identified a small subset of GI components as the most predictive. In a regression setting, a recurrent neural network outperformed other architectures, attaining an R <sup>2</sup> of 0.537, though high-flexibility values were systematically underestimated. Cluster-specific analyses indicated that coil-rich and β-sheet-dominated proteins were more amenable to flexibility prediction than α-helical proteins, likely due to greater structural heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate that compact GI descriptors preserve sufficient information to recover MD-derived flexibility trends, offering a computationally efficient complement to simulation-based approaches. This framework enables large-scale screening of protein dynamics from structural data alone, with potential applications in structural bioinformatics, drug design, and functional annotation.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2025
41040075,Integrative transcriptomic analysis reveals diagnostic biomarkers for comorbidity of coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea.,"The co-occurrence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), termed CADOSA, leads to worse clinical outcomes than either condition alone, yet its molecular mechanisms remain unclear, necessitating biomarker discovery for improved diagnosis and personalized management. This study enrolled 96 age-matched participants (24 healthy controls, 25 CAD, 23 OSA, and 24 CADOSA) for clinical assessment and PBMC transcriptomic profiling. Integrated bioinformatics analyses included differential gene expression (edgeR/DESeq2), pathway enrichment, protein-protein interaction networks and topological analysis, machine learning-based biomarker selection, and immune cell infiltration evaluation. CADOSA patients had more severe cardiac dysfunction (enlarged left ventricle), respiratory impairment (higher apnea-hypopnea index), and metabolic disturbances (elevated triglycerides/creatinine) compared to single-disease condition of CAD or OSA. Transcriptomics identified 832 CAD-specific, 166 OSA-specific, and 376 CADOSA-specific DEGs compared to the healthy control. The CADOSA exhibited both shared (impaired efferocytosis, neutrophil extracellular traps, and cytoskeletal abnormalities) and unique enriched pathways (NOD-like receptor/PPAR signaling pathway), predominantly associated with immune or metabolic dysregulation. Enhanced expression of S100A12 and MMP9 genes (AUC = 0.83 and 0.78, respectively) was identified as potential biomarkers for CADOSA, and their upregulation was further confirmed by qRT-PCR. Notably, S100A12 expression was correlated with increased monocyte infiltration, highlighting its role in inflammatory pathogenesis of CADOSA. These findings reveal immune-metabolic dysregulation underlying CADOSA and provide potential diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapeutic targets (S100A12 and MMP9) for CADOSA patients.",Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2025
41039706,Integrated lipidomics and proteomics analysis in the cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury.,"This study aimed to identify potential serum biomarkers and explore associated signaling pathways involved in cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) by integrating proteomic and lipidomic analyses. A total of 34 patients were enrolled, including 17 CSA-AKI patients and 17 controls. Untargeted lipidomic analysis was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach. Proteomics analysis was conducted using data-independent acquisition-based LC-MS/MS detection. The integration of proteomics and lipidomics was evaluated using statistical and bioinformatics methods. The two groups had different serum protein and lipid profiles, which included 185 differentially expressed proteins and 65 differentially expressed lipids. The protein and lipid molecules were enriched in biologic pathway implicated in biosynthesis of arachidonic acid metabolism, gonadotropin-releasing hormone signaling pathway, leukocyte trans endothelial migration, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Correlation analysis revealed that 4 proteins were positively correlated with 21 lipids, whereas 7 proteins were negatively correlated with the 21 lipids. These results suggested that significantly altered proteins and lipids may be involved in the early stage of CSA-AKI and could serve as potentially promising markers. The association between proteins and lipid molecules and the underlying signaling pathways may elucidate the pathogenesis of CSA-AKI.",Renal failure,2025
41039700,Ultraviolet-B Irradiation Induces miR-663a and miR-4706 Accelerated Photoaging by Targeting Sirtuin 6 in Human Dermal Fibroblasts.,"Ultraviolet (UV) radiation contributes to premature skin aging, and sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) plays key roles in aging, genomic stability, inflammation, and metabolism. However, the specific role of SIRT6 in UV-induced photoaging remains unclear. To investigate the role of SIRT6 in UVB-induced skin photoaging and uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying its regulation. A UVB-induced photoaging mouse model was established, and the role of SIRT6 was determined in vivo using histopathological and transcriptomic analyses. Candidate miRNAs targeting SIRT6 were predicted using bioinformatics tools and validated using dual-luciferase reporter assays. SIRT6 protein levels were measured via western blotting, and miRNA expression was analyzed via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Functional assays were conducted using human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) to assess cellular senescence, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and DNA damage. SIRT6 deficiency substantially exacerbated UVB-induced skin aging, characterized by collagen degradation, elastin fragmentation, and dermal structure loss. Moreover, miR-663a and miR-4706 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region of SIRT6 and were upregulated in HDFs after UVB exposure. Overexpression of these miRNAs promoted HDFs senescence, DNA damage, and ROS accumulation, thus mirroring the effects of SIRT6 silencing. Furthermore, SIRT6 was confirmed as a key regulator of the gene networks involved in skin immune responses and inflammation following chronic UVB exposure. The study enriches existing knowledge regarding the molecular connections between miRNAs and SIRT6. Moreover, the study provides new insights into miRNA-mediated SIRT6 regulation and proposes an intervention point for the prevention of UVB-induced photoaging and age-related diseases.","Photodermatology, photoimmunology & photomedicine",2025
41039617,Toxin data quality: a critical examination of bacterial exotoxins and animal toxins.,"Existing toxins datasets include a mixture of proteins and toxin peptides. In this study we present two curated datasets of toxic proteins free of associated proteins: bacterial exotoxins and animal toxins. Our stringent selection criteria resulted in two data sets with only toxins that directly target or disrupt vital molecular mechanisms of their target organism. To gain insight in their properties and differences, we compared both sets of toxins to controls, and used simple biophysical features such as protein length, and amino acid composition distinguishing between evolutionary kingdoms (phyla). This approach should reveal if there is a need to consider differences present in toxin sets depending on their origin. Our analysis revealed biophysical differences between animal and bacterial toxins that should not be ignored. Both toxin groups exhibited preferencial amino acid usage depending on their origin, together with higher cysteine content compared to their respective controls. The animal toxins set contains, on average, significantly shorter sequences than bacterial toxins, and had their isoelectric point shifted towards acidic pH values. We show that animal toxins and bacterial toxins possess intrinsic differences in general biophysical properties, which reinforce the necessity of segregating these datasets to ensure reliability of bioinformatics models aimed at understanding and predicting toxin characteristics.",BMC research notes,2025
41039548,Microbiome-metabolome interplay in pancreatic cancer progression: insights from multi-omics analysis.,"Recent studies suggest that intratumoral microbiome and altered metabolic networks play crucial roles in pancreatic cancer (PC) progression. However, the precise interplay between microbial communities and tumor metabolism in PC remains poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the impact of the intratumoral microbiome, the metabolic landscape, and their interactions on PC development. 16S rDNA sequencing and Untargeted metabolomic profiling were performed on 47 paired pancreatic cancer and adjacent normal tissues to analyze their intratumoral microbiome and metabolic landscapes. Bioinformatics tools were used to conduct differential microbiome abundance analysis and pathway enrichment. A correlation analysis was performed to identify key microbiota-metabolite interactions. 16S rDNA sequencing revealed significant differences in the abundance and diversity (α-diversity and β-diversity) of the intratumoral microbiome in PC. The predominant species in pancreatic cancer were Pseudomonas. Enrichment analysis showed that amino acid metabolic pathways, including Arginine and Proline Metabolism, Arginine Biosynthesis, were significantly enriched in PC. Untargeted metabolomics identified 298 metabolites that were significantly altered in PC (fold change > 1.5, P-value < 0.05). These included amino acid metabolites such as Lys-Leu, Pro-Leu, Arg-Leu, Lys-Val, His-Lys, and others. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted several metabolic pathways that play important roles in pancreatic cancer, including Glycine, Serine, and Threonine Metabolism, Amino Acid Biosynthesis, Metabolic Pathways and Cysteine and Methionine Metabolism. Correlation analysis between microbiome and metabolic data revealed significant associations between Pseudomonas and several metabolites, including Alpha-ketoisovaleric acid, 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, Myristic acid, Nonanoic acid (the Spearman correlation coefficient r, 0.5 ≤|r|≤ 1 and P-value < 0.05). This study suggests a relationship between the microbiome and metabolism in pancreatic cancer. We observed that Pseudomonas contributes to altered amino acid metabolism, but whether this interaction is causal and the mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. Further experimental validation is required before considering microbiome-targeted metabolic interventions as viable therapeutic strategies.",Molecular cancer,2025
41039458,VISTA expressed on tumor cells is regulated by m6A and influences immune microenvironment through STAT3/CCL22 in NSCLC.,"Immunotherapy is playing an increasingly vital role in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet the challenge of immune evasion remains prevalent. Therefore, investigating the regulatory mechanisms of the tumor immune microenvironment could yield significant benefits. This study utilized differential expression analysis, WGCNA, and Lasso-Cox to analyze the GSE126044 dataset, identifying N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-related molecules that play significant roles in immunotherapy. The m6A modification of the molecule were validated through m6A dot blot, MeRIP, RNA pull-down and RNA stability assays. Their impact on the biological behavior of tumor cells (TCs) was evaluated by CCK-8 assays, wound healing assays, transwell assays, co-culture experiments and flow cytometry. Furthermore, RNA sequencing was conducted to uncover downstream pathways and cytokines, followed by subsequent validation. Lastly, validation was carried out in vivo. Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified that V-domain Immunoglobulin Suppressor of T cell Activation (VISTA) serves a crucial role in immunotherapy and that its expression is regulated by m6A. It was subsequently confirmed that METTL3 enhances the m6A modification levels of VISTA mRNA, which is recognized by YTHDF1. This interaction improved the stability of VISTA mRNA, leading to increased expression of VISTA proteins on the surface of TCs. The elevated expression of VISTA boosted the cytotoxic response of CD8 + T cells toward TCs. RNA sequencing analysis indicated that the JAK/STAT pathway significantly contributes to this process. Overexpression of VISTA on TCs decreased the phosphorylation of STAT3, which in turn reduced the expression and release of CCL22. This reduction alleviated immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment, resulting in increased enrichment and activity of CD8 + T cells and decreased enrichment of regulatory T cells (Tregs), ultimately enhancing their cytotoxic effects against TCs. We conduct a pioneering systematic study on the expression, function, and molecular mechanisms of the VISTA molecule on NSCLC TCs. We propose that in the tumor immune microenvironment, VISTA functions as both an immune checkpoint and a regulator of CD8 + T cell activation/recruitment and Treg recruitment via its expression on TCs.",Journal of translational medicine,2025
41039349,Construction of diagnostic model and subtype analysis of major depressive disorder based on PANoptosis key genes.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious neuropsychiatric disorder. While emerging evidence suggests that PANoptosis may play a role in MDD pathogenesis, the precise involvement of PANoptosis-related genes remains unclear. The study conducted a systematic bioinformatics investigation utilizing the GSE98793 dataset. First, we identified differentially expressed PANoptosis-related genes (DE-PRGs). Second, Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were carried out based on DE-PRGs. Additionally, Random Forest analysis, LASSO regression analysis, immune infiltration analysis, consensus cluster analysis, and single sample genome enrichment analysis were performed. Finally, the expression levels of PANoptosis key genes (PKGs) in MDD were verified using qRT-PCR. Eight PKGs associated with MDD were identified: TRAF1, TNFSF13, TLR2, SH2D1A, RNF144B, ICAM1, HK2, and ADA. Moreover, these PKGs enabled construction of a diagnostic model for MDD PANoptosis risk and stratification of MDD patients into two distinct PANoptosis subtypes (cluster 1 and cluster 2) with differential immune characteristics. Notably, RNF144B and HK2 demonstrated neutrophil-stimulating potential and significant upregulation in MDD patients. This study established a PANoptosis-based diagnostic framework for MDD and identified PANoptosis-stratified MDD subtypes, providing compelling evidence for PANoptosis-mediated immune dysregulation in MDD pathogenesis. These results offered a novel perspective for the diagnosis and management of MDD.",BMC psychiatry,2025
41039310,Integrative transcriptomic analysis reveals cross-species conserved core genes and pathways in alveolar macrophages during ALI/ARDS.,"acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe pulmonary condition characterized by alveolar-capillary damage and refractory hypoxemia. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a crucial role in regulating inflammation and repair processes during acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS. However, the transcriptional and functional changes in AMs during ALI/ARDS remain poorly understood, especially when considering species-specific differences between murine models and human pathophysiology. This study aims to elucidate these changes in AMs during ALI/ARDS by integrating in vitro and cross-species transcriptomic analyses. We conducted RNA sequencing on LPS-stimulated MH-S cells and integrated the data with publicly available murine (GSE225406) and human (GSE40885) AM datasets to identify conserved differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms. Core genes were identified and validated using qRT-PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemical staining, and immunofluorescence staining. Additionally, we analyzed the diagnostic potential of these core genes using clinical datasets (GSE121871 and GSE243066). We identified 45 conserved upregulated genes and 4 downregulated genes across species, highlighting core transcriptional regulators of LPS-induced Macrophage activation. Functional enrichment analysis revealed significant involvement of immune-inflammatory pathways. PPI network analysis identified 10 core genes potentially central to AM-mediated ALI/ARDS pathogenesis. Experimental validation confirmed the upregulation of key genes and demonstrated that LPS treatment significantly impaired the efferocytosis capacity of AMs with dysregulated expression of stabilin-2, suggesting a potential association with this functional defect. Furthermore, the core gene set showed diagnostic potential in ARDS patient samples (AUC = 0.86). This analysis identifies cross-species conserved core genes and inflammatory pathways in AMs during ALI/ARDS. Our findings provide insights into AM-mediated inflammatory mechanisms and highlight candidate genes for further functional studies to explore their potential as therapeutic targets.",BMC pulmonary medicine,2025
41039037,"Exploration of isolated actives from Coleus amboinicus leaves as anticancer agents: in vitro testing, network pharmacology studies, and molecular docking.","Cancer is one of the serious health problems and is a major cause of death worldwide. Therefore, the development of anticancer agents is urgently needed. A potential and novel anticancer agent was successfully isolated from Coleus amboinicus (C. amboinicus) leaves (16-hydroxy-7α-acetoxyroyleanone compound). This study aims to explore the cytotoxic activity of the isolated compound against various cancer cells in vitro, network pharmacology studies on pathways in cancer, and molecular docking. Cytotoxicity testing using the tetrazolium microculture technique (MTT test) against MCF-7, A549, HeLa, and Du-145 cancer cell lines and the normal cell line (CV-1). Network pharmacology studies were carried out using bioinformatics with a database focused on three main proteins in the pathway in cancer and molecular docking was carried out computationally. The cytotoxic activity (IC<sub>50</sub>) of the active compound against MCF-7, A549, HeLa, and Du-145 cells was 4.22, 18.10, 6.31, and 4.67 μg/mL, respectively, while the IC<sub>50</sub> value in CV-1 cells was 19.27 μg/mL. The study of the network pharmacology approach to the cancer pathway of each cancer target revealed that the active compounds target the same three main proteins, namely MMP2, PPARG, and BCl2. In addition, the results of molecular docking showed a high binding affinity between the active compounds and the receptors of the target cancer therapy targets. In general, based on the data and analysis carried out, it shows that the bioactive compounds provide promising anticancer activity, especially for breast and prostate cancer drug agents, because the bioactive compounds provide lower IC<sub>50</sub> and higher SI value than cisplatin as the standard drug, as indicated by the statistical analysis.",Scientific reports,2025
41038334,A Review of Host and Pathogen Gene Targets for RNAi Therapeutics in Shrimp Disease Mitigation.,"RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a powerful therapeutic and research tool in shrimp aquaculture, with its significant potential for disease mitigation. This review explores the strategic targeting of essential genes-either from the host gene or the pathogen-as a basis for RNAi-based therapies in shrimp. Targeting host genes, especially those involved in immune responses, can lead to increased protective effects but also poses risks of lethality if essential physiological pathways are disrupted. Conversely, silencing pathogen genes offers pathogen-specific intervention, though with limitations in broad-spectrum applicability and potential off-target effects. This paper further discusses multi-variant RNAi approaches that target both host and pathogen genes, highlighting their potential in achieving greater protective effects. Also included is a review of Bioinformatics and AI applications in RNAi, and the possibilities it may offer for gene silencing in shrimp. Current evidence suggests that targeting host immune-related genes may yield higher survival outcomes, but a tailored, case-by-case approach remains important. Ultimately, the choice of target depends on a nuanced understanding of host-pathogen interactions. The findings underscore the need for continued research to optimize RNAi strategies for sustainable shrimp disease management.",Developmental and comparative immunology,2025
41038302,LILRB4 in tumor-associated macrophage regulates macrophage polarization and glioblastoma progression via STAT3/IL10 axis.,"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain tumor, exhibits a profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) dominated by M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). The leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4 (LILRB4) has emerged as a critical immunoregulatory molecule implicated in cancer progression, yet its role in GBM remains poorly understood. This study investigated the expression, prognostic significance, and functional role of LILRB4 in TAM-mediated immunosuppression and GBM progression. Expression patterns and prognostic significance of LILRB4 were analyzed using TCGA and validation datasets. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics (ST), and proteogenomics analyses identified cellular sources and spatial distribution of LILRB4. THP-1 cells were differentiated into TAM-like macrophages using PMA and tumor-conditioned medium (TCM) from GBM cells. LILRB4 was silenced using shRNA, and macrophage polarization markers were assessed by RT-qPCR, western blot, and ELISA. LILRB4 was identified as an independent prognostic factor in glioma, with high expression correlating with poor survival. Multiple bioinformatics approaches revealed strong LILRB4-M2 macrophage associations. ST revealed predominant LILRB4 expression in macrophage clusters with strongest tumor cell co-occurrence, identifying LAIR1 as a potential receptor. Proteogenomics analysis showed strong LILRB4 protein-mRNA correlations and associations with M2 markers. LILRB4 regulated macrophage polarization through the STAT3/IL10 axis. Knockdown reversed M2-like phenotype toward M1-like state, decreasing CD163, IL10, and TGFB1 while increasing IL1B and TNFA. TCM from LILRB4 knockdown macrophages significantly inhibited GBM cell proliferation. LILRB4 might functions as a critical regulator of the immunosuppressive TME in GBM by promoting M2 macrophage polarization through the STAT3/IL10 axis. Targeting LILRB4 represents a promising approach for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy in GBM.",Gene,2025
41038282,Breaking Boundaries in Histone Modification MS-based Detection: A Tailored Search Strategy for Unrestricted identification of novel epigenetic marks.,"Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and maintaining DNA integrity, and their aberrations are linked to various diseases, including cancer. While lysine acetylation and methylation have been extensively studied, recent research has uncovered additional PTMs that significantly contribute to chromatin structure and function. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the most effective analytical method for studying histone PTMs; however, computational limitations often restrict the analysis to common modifications. Unrestrictive search strategies have the potential to enable a more comprehensive characterization of the histone modification landscape. In this work, we systematically assess the application of unrestrictive search approaches to histone data. After evaluating the limitations of these methods, we develop a novel bioinformatics workflow, named HiP-Frag (Histone PTM analysis with FragPipe), which enables the identification of 96 sites decorated with uncommon PTMs on core histones-60 of which were previously unreported-as well as 55 histone marks on linker histones, including 13 novel ones, purified from human cell lines and primary samples. The expanded histone PTM analysis enabled by this strategy is among the first to extract previously unexplored epigenetic information from MS raw data. This approach paves the way for a facilitated and more streamlined identification of uncommon and yet unannotated histone modifications, supporting a deeper dissection of the histone code and the understanding of the potential biological role of the novel epigenetic marks.",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,2025
41038150,Angelica sinensis and Scutellaria baicalensis synergistically alleviates metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis via promoting adipose tissue-to-liver tissue communication.,"The synergistic use of Danggui (Angelica sinensis, As) and Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis or Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, SbG; As-SbG) exhibits a notable therapeutic effect on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). However, the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of their synergistic action have not yet been fully elucidated. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the synergistic application of As-SbG on MASH induced by various dietary patterns, and to identify the specific potential active compounds, underlying pharmacological mechanisms, and key therapeutic targets responsible for its anti-MASH effects. Two MASH animal models induced by methionine- and choline- deficient (MCD) diet and high-fat/high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet were constructed to compare the efficacy of As, SbG and As-SbG synergistic treatment on adipose tissue and liver tissue during MASH progression. Potential mechanistic pathways and key molecular targets were identified through proteomics analysis. The chemical components of As-SbG were characterized using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS). The interactions between the identified bioactive components and the key targets from proteomics were further validated using molecular docking methods, focusing on As-SbG's therapeutic potential. Based on these bioinformatics findings, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blotting were employed to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of As-SbG combination therapy on lipid metabolism, inflammation, and apoptosis-related pathways in both in vitro and in vivo MASH models. Compared with single-flavor administration of As and SbG, As-SbG synergistic administration significantly restored the balance among different phenotypes, functions, and sizes of various adipose tissues in MASH-induced mice under different dietary conditions, ameliorated hepatic steatosis and liver damage. Proteomic analysis revealed that the potential synergistic therapeutic effects of As-SbG on MASH were primarily associated with pathways involved in fat metabolism, anti-inflammatory responses, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Mechanism exploration revealed that the As-SbG synergistic therapy enhanced the expression of Nrg4 in adipose tissue, which specifically bound to ErbB receptors in liver tissue. This interaction activated the downstream PI3K/Akt, Ras/MAPK, and P53 signaling pathways, thereby promoting inter-tissue communication between adipose and liver tissues. Consequently, this regulatory effect improved hepatic lipid metabolism, suppressed inflammatory responses, and reduced hepatocellular damage, fibrosis, and apoptosis, ultimately ameliorating MASH. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the key target ErbB4 in vitro abolished the protective effects of the As-SbG synergistic therapy against MASH. Additionally, a total of 31 chemical components of As-SbG were identified using UPLCHRMS. Molecular docking analyses confirmed that Levistilide A, a compound derived from As, exhibits strong binding affinity with multiple key targets involved in various signaling pathways, including fat metabolism, anti-inflammatory responses, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Several bioactive compounds identified in SbG, such as Baicalein, Scutellarin, Oroxindin, and Neobaicalein, also demonstrated favorable interactions with these pathway-associated targets. These findings provide robust evidence supporting the hypothesis that the synergistic application of As-SbG exerts therapeutic effects on MASH through a multi-component, multi-pathway, and multi-target mechanism, highlighting a novel approach of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the treatment of MASH-related diseases. As-SbG synergistic therapy activates Nrg4 expression in adipose tissue, which specifically binds to ErbB receptors in liver tissue, thereby modulating downstream signal transduction pathways involved in fat metabolism, anti-inflammatory responses, and anti-apoptotic processes. This inter-communication between adipose and liver tissues helps restore hepatic lipid homeostasis, attenuates inflammation, and reduces hepatocyte injury, fibrosis, and apoptosis, ultimately ameliorating MASH induced by diverse dietary regimens.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2025

This study investigates the function and molecular mechanism of LINC00673 in the progression of osteosarcoma. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to assess the expression levels of LINC00673 in osteosarcoma cells and tissues. Additionally, we evaluated the correlation between LINC00673 expression in osteosarcoma tissues and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients. Various assays, including CCK-8, Colony formation assay, Transwell assay, and nude animal model experiments, were conducted to investigate the biological function of LINC00673 in osteosarcoma both in vivo and vitro. Downstream target genes of LINC00673 were identified through whole transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics tools, followed by validation using qRT-PCR, western blotting, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and rescue experiments. In our study, we found that LINC00673 is highly expressed in osteosarcoma cells and tissues. The upregulation of LINC00673 was positively correlated with advanced clinical stages and distant metastasis in patients with osteosarcoma. The knockdown of LINC00673 suppressed both cell proliferation and metastasis of osteosarcoma in vivo and vitro. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that LINC00673 functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). enhancing DUSP1 expression by sponging miR-92b-3p. LINC00673 functions as an oncogenic lncRNA in osteosarcoma by enhancing the malignant phenotype of osteosarcoma through miR-92b-3p/DUSP1 axis.","Pathology, research and practice",2025

ADSCs-derived exosomes (ADSCs-exos), as an innovative cell-free therapeutic agent that influences numerous biological processes, including immunological modulation, reduction of oxidative damage, and enhancement of tissue repair and regeneration. In vitro experiments were performed to evaluate the impact of hsa_circ_0028877 on cellular proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and osteoclast differentiation. The study examined the regulatory function of ADSCs-exos on the hsa_circ_0028877/miR-4728-3p/PTCH1 axis and its therapeutic implications for osteoporosis. The ovariectomised rat (OVX) model was employed to simulate PMOP. The impact of hsa_circ_0028877 overexpression and knockdown on the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were examined. The RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) method was employed to validate the connection among hsa_circ_0028877, miR-4728-3p, and PTCH1. ADSCs-exos modulate their downstream molecular pathway by obstructing the nuclear transport of hsa_circ_0028877. The impact of ADSCs-exos on bone mass, trabecular microstructure, and the mineralization capacity of BMSCs was evaluated in a rat model. hsa_circ_0028877 is significantly expressed in ovariectomised rat BMSCs. hsa_circ_0028877 enhances PTCH1 expression through its interaction with miR-4728-3p. ADSCs-exos can rehabilitate bone mass in the distal femur of ovariectomised rats.

ADSCs-exos promote osteogenic differentiation and bone formation in BMSCs by obstructing the nuclear export of hsa_circ_0028877 and modulating the hsa_circ_0028877/miR-4728-3p/PTCH1 axis, thereby improving PMOP.",International immunopharmacology,2025
41037502,Improving the Catalytic Activity of a Quinone-Dependent Dehydrogenase for Deoxynivalenol Detoxification by Engineering the Conformation of the N-Terminal Loop.,"The low oxidation activity of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent dehydrogenase (DepA) toward deoxynivalenol (DON) restricts its practical application in the food industry. Here, bioinformatics analysis indicated that the N-terminal loop of DepA acts as a lid that swings above the active pocket and plays an important role in controlling substrate entry. Considering that different PQQ-dependent dehydrogenases have different N-terminal loop lengths, we constructed DepA N-terminal truncation mutants. The catalytic efficiency (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>) of the best truncation mutant, N21, increased by 7.9-fold. Computational analysis suggested that mutant N21 maintains the open conformation of the N-terminal loop and widens the substrate channel to increase the level of substrate entry. In addition, the active pocket of mutant N21 was reshaped, which strengthened the interaction between DON and the active cavity residues and reduced the proton transfer distance, enhancing catalytic activity. This study provides new insights into engineering the catalytic activity of PQQ-dependent dehydrogenases.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2025
41037282,Analysis of the interaction of TATA-box binding protein 1 and 2 from <i>Taenia solium</i> to TATA-box: structural factors related to selectivity and affinity.,"TATA-box binding protein (TBP) is a core subunit of the transcription factor TFIID and plays a pivotal role in recognizing the TATA-box in protein-coding genes, facilitating the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex. In <i>Taenia solium</i>, only one TBP isoform (TsTBP1) has been previously reported. Here, we identify and characterize a second isoform, TsTBP2, using a combination of molecular biology and bioinformatics approaches. TsTBP2 shares 42% primary sequence identity with TsTBP1 and exhibits distinct expression patterns between cysticerci and adult stages. To investigate the molecular determinants of DNA recognition, selectivity, and binding affinity, we performed molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations for both TsTBPs with various TATA-box sequences. Our results reveal that TsTBP1 exhibits higher affinity for <i>T. solium</i> TATA-box sequences compared to the consensus AdML TATA-box (TATAAAAG), largely due to the specific interaction of critical phenylalanine residues with the DNA minor groove, which induces DNA bending and stabilizes the TBP-DNA complex. Furthermore, analysis of the Buckle parameter indicates that these Phe residues are the principal contributors to DNA distortion. To our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of TBP selectivity and affinity in cestodes, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation in <i>T. solium</i>.",Transcription,2025
41037245,Comparative transcriptomic and machine learning analysis identifies key genes and immune dysregulation in goats exposed to peste des petits ruminants virus.,"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) continues to pose a significant challenge in endemic regions, such as India, despite ongoing vaccination efforts. Although the existing vaccines are effective, they have certain limitations, such as thermolability and the inability to distinguish between infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA). Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing host-pathogen interactions during natural infection versus vaccine-induced immunity is crucial for developing next-generation control strategies. This study conducted comparative transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from naturally PPRV-infected goats (GSE132429, n = 16) and Sungri/96-vaccinated goats (GSE155504, n = 10) to decipher shared and distinct molecular signatures of protective immunity. Differential gene expression identified 1,874 DEGs in infected samples (238 up-regulated, 534 down-regulated) and 1,838 DEGs in vaccinated samples (286 up-regulated, 534 down-regulated). Comparative analysis revealed 12 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated hub genes shared between both conditions, demonstrating that vaccination successfully activates similar protective immune pathways as natural infection, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, IL-17 signaling, and RIG-like receptor signaling. Importantly, condition-specific genes were identified that distinguish infection from vaccination: infection-specific genes like IL-6 and IL1A indicated pathological inflammation, while vaccination-specific genes included ribosomal proteins (RPS27A, RPS14, RPS29, RPS18), reflecting controlled immune memory formation. Machine learning validation of these unique hub genes achieved exceptional classification accuracy (> 90%), confirming their robust biomarker potential for DIVA applications in distinguishing PPRV-infected animals from vaccinated animals. These findings establish that current PPR vaccines effectively mimic key aspects of natural infection while maintaining distinct protective characteristics, offering potential targets for developing enhanced diagnostic tools, next-generation vaccines with DIVA capabilities, and targeted therapeutic interventions to reduce PPR burden on small ruminant populations.",Virus genes,2025
41037232,TAMs-derived exosomes promote breast cancer progression by regulating the IRF9/IFI6 axis.,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent cancer diagnosed in women across the globe and is the main factor behind cancer-related deaths in women. There is an increasing amount of evidence, suggesting that tumor microenvironment is controlled by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and exosomes. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism of TAMs-derived exosomes to regulate the advancement of BC is not entirely clear. The proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, glycolysis, and the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in BC cells were evaluated using EdU, Transwell assays, flow cytometry, and corresponding kits. RT-qPCR and western blotting were employed to examine mRNA and protein expression. Exosomes were isolated from TAMs culture supernatant and confirmed through transmission electron microscopy, western blotting, and immunofluorescence assay. Bioinformatics, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay were utilized to determine the binding of IRF9 to the IFI6 promoter. A mouse xenograft model was established for in vivo analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was conducted on a pre-selected interferon-related gene set, which may limit the discovery of other relevant genes and pathways. Interferon alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) was highly expressed in TAMs-originated exosomes. TAMs promoted BC cells' proliferation, migration, invasion, and glycolysis through the transmission of exosomal IFI6 while inhibiting apoptosis and ROS accumulation. Interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) promoted IFI6 transcription in TAMs. Mechanistically, IRF9 in TAMs-secreted exosomes promoted the function of BC cells by mediating IFI6. Furthermore, TAMs-derived exosomes influenced the growth of BC tumors by regulating the IRF9/IFI6 axis in vivo. Generally, TAMs-derived exosomes could promote BC progression via the IRF9/IFI6 axis.","Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan)",2025
41037154,Comprehensive bioinformatics evaluation uncovers the possible oncogenic contribution of acrylamide to endometrial cancer.,"Endometrial cancer (EC) is a prevalent gynecological malignancy with increasing incidence worldwide. Despite advancements in treatment, challenges such as tumor recurrence and chemoresistance persist. Acrylamide, a probable carcinogen formed in high-temperature cooked foods, has been associated with EC risk, but its oncogenic mechanisms remain underexplored. Transcriptomic data from GEO datasets (GSE17025, GSE63678, GSE106191, GSE115810) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (PRJNA786266) were integrated to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the limma package. Acrylamide molecular targets were predicted via SwissTargetPrediction and ChEMBL databases. Machine learning approaches, including LASSO regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, were employed to identify key genes. SHAP analysis evaluated gene importance, while ssGSEA assessed immune cell infiltration. Molecular docking experiments investigated acrylamide's binding affinity with key proteins. Differential expression analysis identified 2274 downregulated and 2545 upregulated genes in EC. Nine consensus genes were identified across GEO DEGs, scRNA-seq, WGCNA modules, and acrylamide targets, enriched in Notch, Wnt, and microRNA pathways. Machine learning pinpointed four key genes: ROCK1, CLK1, SIRT1, and PSENEN. SHAP analysis highlighted ROCK1 as the top predictor (AUC = 1.00). ssGSEA revealed significant correlations between these genes and immune cell infiltration, particularly with NK and T cells. Molecular docking confirmed strong binding affinities of acrylamide with CLK1 (- 6.3 kcal/mol), PSENEN (- 6.1 kcal/mol), ROCK1 (- 6.0 kcal/mol), and SIRT1 (- 5.8 kcal/mol). This study elucidates acrylamide's potential oncogenic role in EC, identifying ROCK1, CLK1, SIRT1, and PSENEN as key mediators. These findings underscore the interplay between dietary exposures and EC pathogenesis, suggesting novel therapeutic targets.

First, FGF21 was upregulated in the serum of patients with myocardial I/R injury as well as in I/R hearts of mice and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). While FGF21 knockout exacerbated such injury, which was mitigated by rhFGF21. Bioinformatics analysis identified immunity-related GTPase M1 (Irgm1) as a key autophagy-related gene downregulated in ventricular tissue of FGF21<sup>-/-</sup> I/R mice. Impaired autophagic flux in FGF21<sup>-/-</sup> mice during I/R could be rescued by rhFGF21 through the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) pathway. The beneficial effects of rhFGF21 in reducing H/R injury were limited in Irgm1 knockdown NRCMs. This study suggested that FGF21 deficiency intensifies myocardial I/R injury by exacerbating the impairment of autophagic flux. Activation of FGF21 or Irgm1 may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for myocardial I/R injury.",Journal of cardiovascular translational research,2025

The comprehensive understanding of their molecular mechanisms remains a critical focus and challenge in current research. This study aims to integrate bioinformatics and single-cell analysis technologies to explore glioma-related cell types and immune cell infiltration features, providing new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of gliomas and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Gene expression profiles were selected from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and a glioma-related gene dataset was obtained from GeneCards. Single-cell analysis was employed to identify cell types, and bioinformatics techniques were applied to identify potential pathogenic targets in gliomas. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, followed by functional enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Ultimately, drug target prediction and molecular docking analysis revealed the mechanisms of potential drugs. Single-cell analysis identified 10 cell types, with microglial cells and oligodendrocytes playing crucial roles in gliomas. Molecular biological analysis identified 20 key genes. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that these hub genes were primarily enriched in processes such as cellular component organization or biogenesis, cellular processes, cell junctions, and catalytic activity. The main signaling pathways involved include the p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle, and cellular senescence. Furthermore, molecular docking results showed that quercetin effectively binds to four hub targets (DLGAP5, TOP2A, CHEK1, MKI67), suggesting that quercetin may improve glioma-related biological features by acting on these targets.

The aim is to characterize serum exosome protein expression profiles in patients diagnosed with OLP and to identify potential disease-associated candidate proteins. Serum samples were collected from 30 participants, comprising erosive OLP patients, non-erosive OLP patients, and healthy controls (n = 10 per group). Serum exosome proteomes were compared across groups following validation of exosomal integrity using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Western blotting. Label-free quantitative proteomic profiling was performed with Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometry, integrated with bioinformatics analyses to identify differentially expressed proteins. About 138 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs, 39↑/99↓) in OLP patients vs controls, with subtype-specific profiles (70 DEPs in non-erosive, 99 in erosive). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that these proteins were predominantly associated with extracellular vesicles, protein binding, and immune response regulation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis highlighted enrichment in the complement and coagulation cascade (<i>p</i> < 0.05), platelet activation, and focal adhesion pathways. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis identified central proteins including fibronectin 1 (FN1), complement component 3 (C3), integrin subunit beta 3 (ITGB3), vinculin (VCL), and SRC proto-oncogene (SRC). Among these, FN1 and C3 were implicated in mediating epithelial-extracellular matrix (ECM) separation and thromboinflammatory activity. The identified differentially expressed proteins in serum exosomes and their association with the complement and coagulation cascade pathway appear to contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of OLP. FN1 and C3 dysregulation directly contributes to OLP pathogenesis via immune-stromal crosstalk. Core proteins such as FN1 and C3 may serve as promising non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, warranting further validation.",Journal of inflammation research,2025
41036401,Whole-genome identification and functional analysis of grape bHLH transcription factors: new insights into the regulation of monoterpene biosynthesis.,"Basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors play critical roles in the regulation of plant secondary metabolism, but the molecular mechanisms involved in monoterpene synthesis by the grape bHLH family have not been systematically resolved. In this research, 12 <i>VvbHLHs</i> were detected in the grape genome, encoding 468-696 amino acids with molecular masses ranging from 52.5 to 77.5 kDa. Phylogenetic analyses showed that grapevine bHLH family members are closely related to dicotyledonous plants such as <i>Pyrus bretschneideri</i> and <i>Malus domestica</i>. These <i>VvbHLHs</i> were mainly localized in the nucleus, and their promoter regions were enriched for cis-acting elements linked to developmental stages and stress resistance. Spatio-temporal expression profiling indicated that <i>VvbHLHs</i> were significantly upregulated during fruit ripening, with the expression of <i>VvbHLH9</i> (<i>VvbHLH041</i>) significantly and positively correlated with monoterpene accumulation. Subcellular localization analysis showed that VvbHLH9 was localized in the nucleus; and transient overexpression assays revealed that <i>VvbHLH9</i> significantly activated monoterpene skeleton genes (<i>VvDXS1</i> and <i>VvDXS4</i>) and synthase genes (<i>VvTPS31</i>, <i>VvTPS32</i>, and <i>VvTPS35</i>) to promote the accumulation of monoterpene metabolites, such as terpinolene, allo-ocimene, nerol, geraniol, cis-furan linalool oxide and linalool. Notably, <i>VvbHLH9</i> lacked the typical bHLH-MYC_N structural domain, suggesting that it may affect the monoterpene metabolic network through a non-classical regulatory mechanism. The present study uncovers the modulatory function of grapevine bHLHs on the synthesis of monoterpene metabolites, providing new targets for grapevine fruit quality improvement and molecular breeding.",Frontiers in plant science,2025

In-vitro studies demonstrated TST's dose-/time-dependent suppression of RMS proliferation (IC50 4.986-9.764 μmol/L), migration and invasion, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis induction. In vivo, TST (3.4 mg/mL, 4 weeks) significantly inhibited tumor growth (<i>p</i> < 0.05 vs. phosphate buffered saline [PBS]) without organ toxicity. RNA sequencing identified the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) pathway as the primary suppressed pathway (False Discovery Rate [FDR] < 0.05), with concurrent downregulation of downstream regulators (<i>AKT, JAK, CDKs</i>). This was confirmed by PI3K activator 740 Y-P rescue experiments, which partially reversed the effects of TST (<i>p</i> < 0.05). These findings establish TST as a multi-mechanism PI3K-AKT inhibitor for refractory RMS while validating Connectivity Map (Cmap)-driven drug repurposing for pediatric oncology.",Pediatric discovery,2025

41036148,Genome Mining and Structural Study of Cathelicidins Across Chiroptera Species.,"The authors explored the genomic landscape of bat cathelicidins, critical proteins in the vertebrate innate immune system, across 41 bat species, which are notable for their high microbial tolerance. An array of bioinformatics tools, complemented by manual mining, were used to identify the curated cathelicidin sequences. Particular attention was given to the fourth exon, which is responsible for generating the biologically active peptide. This comprehensive exploration led to the identification of 72 annotated complete cathelicidins, with 44 being newly discovered. These 72 complete cathelicidin sequences, along with 7 incomplete and 4 nonfunctional sequences, result in a total of 78 peptides, 53 of which were previously unknown. These bat cathelicidins are characterized by a cathelicidin domain pfam00666, and the consensus sequence derived from aligning these domains shows a high degree of conservation in the position of each amino acid across all bat species, suggesting that they possess only one type of cathelicidin. Notably, the three-dimensional structure of the bat cathelicidin family domain closely resembles the cystatin domain previously described in <i>Sus scrofa</i> protegrin 3. The phylogenetic tree constructed using the bat conserved domain cluster species according to their taxonomic order, indicating the potential utility of this sequence as taxonomic markers. Finally, the authors propose a peptide classification based on three-dimensional structures and the presence or absence of the CAP18 domain, proline-rich or arginine-rich sequences. This approach holds great promise for future research focussed on precisely identifying antimicrobial peptides, conducting structure-activity and mechanism-of-action relationship studies and enhancing our understanding of the immune defence mechanisms in bats.",Biochemistry research international,2025

41036009,Harnessing bioinformatics and recombinant technology to combat avian coccidiosis: A 19-kDa sporozoite protein-based vaccine.,"Coccidiosis is an economically important disease caused by <i>Eimeria</i> species in poultry. This study aimed to design, express, and evaluate a recombinant 19-kDa sporozoite protein (E19kDa) as a vaccine candidate against mixed <i>Eimeria</i> infection in broiler chickens. The study used bioinformatic analysis, protein expression analysis, immunization trials, and immune response evaluation were performed. Protein properties were predicted using bioinformatics tools. Gene 838 (Accession No. PV347147) was cloned into a pET-28b plasmid and expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> BL21(DE3). IPTG induction levels were optimized, and expression was confirmed via quantitative PCR. The protein was purified using Ni-NTA chromatography and validated by SDS-PAGE. Twenty Ross 308 chickens were divided into negative control, positive control (infected), and challenge group. Birds in the vaccine group received two subcutaneous doses of E19kDa with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. The challenge was performed using a mixed <i>Eimeria</i> oocyst suspension (1 × 10⁴ oocysts per species). Immunity was assessed through live weight, oocyst counts, white blood cell counts, and IgY levels. The results showed high expression of E19kDa at 1 mM IPTG. SDS-PAGE confirmed the purified protein at ~29kDa. Immunized birds exhibited better weight gain, lower oocyst counts (10,245 versus 22,755), and increased white blood cell counts and IgY titers compared with infected controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed a peak antibody response on day 28 post-vaccination. The vaccine significantly reduced clinical symptoms and mortality. This study highlights the potential of the recombinant E19kDa protein as a promising candidate vaccine against coccidiosis.

41036007,"Phylogenetic analysis of swine influenza viruses circulating in slaughterhouses in Thanh Hoa province, Vietnam, during 2024 and early 2025.","Swine influenza viruses (SIVs) is a highly infectious viral disease in pig population. This disease is caused by the influenza A virus. According to the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), three subtypes of SIVs have been officially reported, including H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. However, information about this pathogen circulated in Vietnam is limited, especially during the last 5 years. This research aimed to examine the molecular characteristics of SIVs circulating in Vietnam. A total of 213 swab samples from 18 slaughterhouses in Thanh Hoa province, North Central Vietnam, were collected between 2024 and early 2025, and SIVs were detected by realtime RT-PCR. The characteristics of these viruses were further determined based on the phylogenetic analysis of the Hemagglutination (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) genes. SIV subtypes were determined by realtime RT-PCR. The full-length HA and NA genes were amplified by PCR. Phylogenetic and characterization analysis of HA and NA nucleotides and proteins were performed using bioinformatics. Virus isolation and titration were performed in the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line. Of 213 samples, 24 were positive for SIVs, representing an 11.27% prevalence at the slaughterhouses (SIVs were confirmed in 5 out of 18 slaughterhouses). These samples included 17 H1N1, 1 H1N2, and 6 H3N2 subtype samples. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes showed that four H1N1 subtypes belonged to the H1N1pdm09 lineage, three to the Eurasian ""avian-like"" (EA) H1N1 lineage, and one to the TR-H1N2 lineage. Additionally, four H3N2 subtypes were classified into clade IV of the recent human-line (RH) H1N1. Based on the NA gene sequences, seven viruses belonged to the EA H1N1 lineage, three to the RH-H3N2 lineage, and one to the TR-H1N2 lineage. Receptor-binding and antigenic site analysis revealed that all isolates could bind to both human- and avian-like receptors. Furthermore, <i>in vitro</i> analysis of the growth kinetics of SIVs showed that 12 SIV isolates could efficiently replicate in MDCK cell lines. Our study demonstrated that all three WOAH subtypes have been circulating in Vietnam during 2024 and early 2025. H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes are predominant, suggesting a potential threat to human health.

41035687,"Efficient inference, training, and fine-tuning of protein language models.","Protein language models (PLMs) have shown great promise in protein structure and function predictions, but their adoption is limited by computational cost. We address this challenge by enhancing the efficiency of evolutionary scale modeling (ESM). Using FlashAttention and sequence packing, we achieve 4-9× faster inference and 3-14× lower memory usage. Four-bit quantization of billion-parameter models further reduces memory by 2-3× while preserving accuracy for missense variant effect prediction. Training is also optimized, cutting runtime 6-fold with methods, such as activation checkpointing and DeepSpeed zero-offload. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of a few adapter weights yields state-of-the-art performance at protein property and function predictions, resulting in 70% Spearman's correlation for melting point and 87% AU-PRC for transcription factor identification.

41035502,A miRNA signature linked to high lipoprotein (a) and coronary calcification in familial hypercholesterolaemia.,"High lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels are associated with increased coronary artery calcification (CAC) in familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) patients. However, mechanisms linking high Lp(a) with CAC remain poorly understood. In this study, we have performed a bioinformatics and system biology analysis to identify miRNAs and their target genes involved in Lp(a)-associated atherosclerotic lesion and coronary calcification in FH patients. Patients with a genetic diagnosis of FH (<i>n</i> = 24) from the SAFEHEART were included in the study. Plasma miRNA signature was obtained using Affymetrix miRNA microarrays from patients with FH grouped using an Lp(a) cut-off of (>50 mg/dL) and presence or absence of coronary artery calcification [CCS(+) or CCS(-)]. <i>In silico</i> analyses were performed to identify potential miRNA target genes. Forty-two miRNAs had > 1.5-fold difference in their detection levels when grouped by Lp(a) [FH-Lp(a)> 50 (<i>n</i> = 9) <i>vs</i> FH-Lp(a)< 50 (<i>n</i> = 15)]. Among these, 9 miRNAs were associated with CCS(+) (miR-1228-5p, miR-3940-5p, miR-1237-5p, miR-3196, miR-6765-5p, miR-6786-5p, miR-4486, miR-6821-5p and miR-1908-5p). <i>In silico</i> analysis, identified 68 target genes of these 9 miRNAs in lipid and atherosclerosis pathways (KEGG code: hsa05417). Network analysis revealed seven target genes (AKT3, APAF1, BCL2L1, TRAF6, MYD88, STAT3, and CASP9) with stronger interactions and higher binding probability for the nine-miRNA signature, mainly linked to lipid metabolism, inflammation and calcification processes.

41035378,Alterations in Gut Microbiota and Metabolism in Cirrhotic Portal Hypertension: Implications for Disease Progression.,"Although gut microbiota has been implicated in various liver disorders, its relationship with cirrhotic portal hypertension (CPH) remains unclear. To investigate the structural and functional alterations of gut microbiota in patients with CPH and the potential role of these alterations in the progression of CPH. We collected faecal samples from 35 patients with CPH and 71 patients without CPH (controls) to conduct microbiome and metabolomic analyses. Gut microbes, faecal metabolites and their functional pathways associated with CPH were identified using multiple bioinformatics approaches. To understand the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of CPH, we carried out faecal microbiota transplantation, CPH-characteristic bacterial transplantation and antibacterial experiments in mice. Microbial diversity was diminished, and gut microbial structures were altered in patients with CPH compared to the controls, primarily manifested as increased abundance of lipopolysaccharide-producing bacteria and decreased abundance of anti-inflammatory bacteria. This dysbiosis of gut microbiota was accompanied by changes in the faecal metabolome, particularly in arginine biosynthesis and nitric oxide production. Transplantation of gut microbiota from CPH patients, as well as the transplantation of CPH-associated bacteria Veillonella nakazawae, was found to exacerbate CPH progression in mice. Antibiotic treatment significantly alleviated the CPH progression induced by N-dimethylnitrosamine in mice. Our study reveals that gut microbiota dysbiosis is implicated in CPH progression, potentially providing new avenues for microbiome-based treatment for CPH.",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,2025
41035371,Oncogenic Role and Drug Resistance Effect of CCDC6 in iCCA: Potential Strategies for Targeted Intervention.,"Intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (iCCA) is a digestive neoplasm with a very poor prognosis. This study examined the role of CCDC6 in the progression of iCCA and gemcitabine resistance through bioinformatics analysis and functional assays. Database analysis showed that CCDC6 was significantly overexpressed in iCCA, with its expression positively correlating with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Although its value as an independent prognostic biomarker was not statistically significant in survival analysis, its expression profile suggested potential as a therapeutic target. Functional experiments demonstrated that CCDC6 knockdown inhibited iCCA cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, while overexpression enhanced these malignant phenotypes. Western blot analysis demonstrated that CCDC6 regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by modulating Vimentin and Snail expression, promoting metastasis. In vivo xenograft and metastasis models confirmed that CCDC6 depletion significantly reduced tumour burden and lung metastases. Moreover, CCDC6 and the EMT marker Vimentin were upregulated in gemcitabine-resistant iCCA cells. γH2AX foci staining indicated that CCDC6 enhanced DNA damage repair (DDR), reducing chemotherapy-induced genomic instability, while CCDC6 inhibition exacerbated DNA damage, reversing resistance. These findings suggest CCDC6 drives chemoresistance through EMT activation and enhanced DDR, making it a promising therapeutic target in iCCA.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2025
41035233,NGSMHC: A simple bioinformatics tool for comprehensively typing MHC genes in non-human species using next-generation sequencing data.,"Understanding the individual- and population-level polymorphisms of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes is crucial for identifying associations between MHC variations and immune phenotypes. To support this, we developed NGSMHC, a streamlined bioinformatics tool for efficient and accurate MHC genotyping using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data in non-human species. NGSMHC constructs phased haplotype contigs of selected MHC genes from BAM-format mapping data and determines the best matching MHC alleles and genotypes via nucleotide BLAST analysis against a user-provided reference set of MHC alleles. We evaluated NGSMHC using short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from 12 pigs, focusing on swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) genes. The typing results from NGSMHC were compared to those obtained using polymerase chain reaction sequence-based typing (PCR-SBT). In addition, we tested NGSMHC on a publicly available long-read WGS dataset with known SLA genotypes. The short-read WGS data showed an average read depth of 20.9× across the SLA region, enabling typing of SLA-2, SLA-3, SLA-DRB1, and SLA-DQB1 using NGSMHC. The concordance rates between NGSMHC and PCR-SBT were 88% for SLA-3, 92% for SLA-DRB1, and 100% for SLA-DQB1. However, SLA-2 typing showed lower concordance (58%), likely due to its high sequence similarity with other SLA class I genes and complex intra-locus polymorphisms. In contrast, NGSMHC accurately identified all tested SLA genotypes-including SLA-1, SLA-2, SLA-3, SLA-DRA, SLA-DRB1, SLA-DQA, and SLA-DQB1-when applied to the long-read WGS data. NGSMHC is a simple and effective tool for MHC genotyping using NGS data, particularly for non-human species. Its accuracy is significantly improved by long-read sequencing, underscoring the importance of read length in precise MHC allele determination.",Animal bioscience,2025
41035053,Chemical classification program synthesis using generative artificial intelligence.,"Accurately classifying chemical structures is essential for cheminformatics and bioinformatics, including tasks such as identifying bioactive compounds of interest, screening molecules for toxicity to humans, finding non-organic compounds with desirable material properties, or organizing large chemical libraries for drug discovery or environmental monitoring. However, manual classification is labor-intensive and difficult to scale to large chemical databases. Existing automated approaches either rely on manually constructed classification rules, or are deep learning methods that lack explainability. This work presents an approach that uses generative artificial intelligence to automatically write chemical classifier programs for classes in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. These programs can be used for efficient deterministic run-time classification of SMILES structures, with natural language explanations. The programs themselves constitute an explainable computable ontological model of chemical class nomenclature, which we call the ChEBI Chemical Class Program Ontology (C3PO). We validated our approach against the ChEBI database, and compared our results against deep learning models and a naive SMARTS pattern based classifier. C3PO outperforms the naive classifier, but does not reach the performance of state of the art deep learning methods. However, C3PO has a number of strengths that complement deep learning methods, including explainability and reduced data dependence. C3PO can be used alongside deep learning classifiers to provide an explanation of the classification, where both methods agree. The programs can be used as part of the ontology development process, and iteratively refined by expert human curators.",Journal of cheminformatics,2025
41035046,MINPP1 promotes ferroptosis in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating CTSB K33-linked deubiquitination via ZRANB1.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is significantly influenced by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, the roles of ferroptosis and ubiquitination modifications in this context remain poorly understood. In this study, we utilized immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and analysis of ubiquitin modifications to explore the regulatory mechanisms of MINPP1 in ferroptosis and its effects on tumor progression. Further mechanistic studies revealed that ZRANB1 regulates the K33-linked ubiquitination of CTSB. Ultimately, the contribution of the MINPP1-CTSB axis to tumor progression was validated using in vivo experiments. Our study demonstrates that MINPP1 regulates ferroptosis in HBV-positive HCC cells via a glycolytic bypass mechanism. Bioinformatics analysis indicates that MINPP1 stabilizes CTSB, thereby participating in the regulation of ferroptosis. Specifically, MINPP1 modulates K33-linked deubiquitination of CTSB through ZRANB1, which stabilizes CTSB expression and identifies its deubiquitination site. In contrast, the MINPP1-ZRANB1-CTSB axis does not regulate ferroptosis in HBV-negative HCC cells. However, upon the introduction of HBV into these cells, the MINPP1-ZRANB1-CTSB axis becomes active and promotes ferroptosis. Finally, in vivo assays showed that MINPP1 regulates tumor progression by regulating K33-linked ubiquitination of CTSB, thereby affecting ferroptosis levels. Our research showed outcomes suggest that the MINPP1-ZRANB1-CTSB axis promotes ferroptosis in HBV-positive HCC cells through glycolysis, emphasizing the function of MINPP1 in mediating ferroptosis in HBV-related HCC cells via CTSB deubiquitination modification. This provides valuable insights and a foundation for the treatment of HBV-associated HCC.",Biology direct,2025

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to identify crotonylation-related biomarkers in PE through bioinformatics analysis. Publicly available datasets, including GSE48424 and GSE149440, were utilized in this study. Candidate biomarkers were identified by intersecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from differential expression analysis with key module genes obtained through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Biomarkers were further refined using expression analysis and machine learning techniques. Functional analysis, immune infiltration analysis, methylation modifications, and construction of molecular regulatory networks were employed to explore the potential mechanisms underlying the involvement of candidate biomarkers in PE pathogenesis. Additionally, associations between the biomarkers and common clinical predictive molecules were examined, and their diagnostic performance for PE was evaluated. A total of 323 candidate genes were identified by intersecting 3,353 DEGs with 402 key module genes. Expression analysis and machine learning algorithms pinpointed DPYD and PRDX3 as biomarkers. DPYD and PRDX3 were identified as lysine crotonylation-related biomarkers in PE. These genes were significantly downregulated in PE and associated with pathways such as olfactory signaling, neutrophil degranulation, and immune microenvironment dysregulation. Both biomarkers demonstrated excellent diagnostic efficacy (AUC > 0.85), outperforming traditional markers like VEGFA. Additionally, DPYD and PRDX3 are associated with oxidative stress and immune dysregulation, which may be the key mechanisms for the development of PE. This study identified DPYD and PRDX3 as lysine crotonylation-related biomarkers in PE, providing new insights for the diagnosis and management of the condition.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,2025
41034744,POLD3 knockdown effects on low-grade glioma: insights from bioinformatics and experimental validation.,"Lower-grade glioma (LGG) is a common primary brain tumor with potential progression to glioblastoma. Its development is closely linked to DNA damage repair. DNA polymerase delta subunit 3 (POLD3), a subunit of the DNA polymerase δ complex, participates in DNA replication and repair. POLD3 may act as a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in LGG. We collected primary data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The CGGA dataset included messenger RNA (mRNA) sequencing and clinical data from 403 LGG cases; its microarray subset contained 142 additional cases. The TCGA dataset provided clinical data for 503 LGG cases. Employing bioinformatics tools, we investigated the correlation of POLD3 expression with the clinical characteristics, pathological features, survival outcomes, and tumor immune microenvironment in LGG. Subsequent functional validation of POLD3's impact in LGG was performed using both cellular and animal models. Integrative analysis combining bioinformatics and experimental approaches revealed significant POLD3 overexpression in LGG. Elevated POLD3 levels exhibited significant associations with distinct clinicopathological features, altered immune cell infiltration profiles, and adverse clinical outcomes. Functionally, POLD3 was demonstrated to drive LGG cell proliferation, invasion, and modulate the tumor microenvironment. This study establishes POLD3 as a critical molecular determinant in LGG pathogenesis. Our findings position POLD3 as a promising multifaceted target, with significant implications for advancing LGG diagnostics, therapeutic development, immune modulation strategies, and prognostic assessment, thereby providing a fresh conceptual framework for understanding and managing this tumor.",BMC cancer,2025

Traditional bioinformatics tools, such as BLAST, help detect sequence similarity but often fall short in handling large-scale genomic data effectively. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), offer powerful alternatives for uncovering complex genomic patterns. However, optimizing these models requires advanced regularization methods to ensure reliability. Integrating bioinformatics with adaptive deep learning techniques provides a robust approach to reveal conserved genes and enhance our understanding of plant genome evolution and function. This study addresses the genomic conservations across four agriculturally vital species wheat, rice, barley and BD by integrating bioinformatics and deep learning to identify genes conserved evolutionarily. The whole genome data for four species were downloaded from Ensembl (253,076 genes). Reciprocal best hits (RBH) via BLASTn reduced the data set to 25,152 highly similar sequences, highlighting shared ancestry, across four species. A novel Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) framework, enhanced with Gradient Responsive Regularization (GRR), was bench-marked against MLP penalized variants (L1, L2, Elastic Net, Adaptive) using learning rates (0.01, 0.001, 0.0001) and batch sizes (16, 32, 64, 128). All models achieved > 99% accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), with the novel GRR performing comparably, e.g. 0.9992 accuracy at Learning Rate (LR) = 0.0001 based all genes (full data). The Novel Gradient Responsive Regularization (GRR) framework achieved state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and MCC). Specifically, at a learning rate of 0.0001, Novel GRR attained peak performance with larger batch sizes (128 and 256) on the RBH filtered dataset (25152 genes), while demonstrating exceptional scalability on the full genomic dataset (253076 genes) at a batch size of 32. Statistical validation via Kruskal Wallis tests (<i>p</i> < 0.05) confirmed the method’s significant advantage over conventional regularization approaches. Notably, Novel GRR maintained consistent superiority across all evaluation phases training, validation, and testing highlighting its robustness for both feature refined (RBH) and genome wide analyses. These results highlights the method’s capacity to adapt to varying data complexities, offering a powerful tool for genomic prediction and evolutionary studies.

41034705,HolomiRA: a reproducible pipeline for miRNA binding site prediction in microbial genomes.,"Small RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), are candidates for mediating communication between the host and its microbiota, regulating bacterial gene expression and influencing microbiome functions and dynamics. Here, we introduce HolomiRA (Holobiome miRNA Affinity Predictor), a computational pipeline developed to predict target sites for host miRNAs in microbiome genomes. HolomiRA operates within a Snakemake workflow, processes microbial genomic sequences in FASTA format using freely available bioinformatics software and incorporates built-in data processing methods. The pipeline begins by annotating protein-coding sequences from microbial genomes using Prokka. It then identifies candidate regions, evaluates them for potential host miRNA binding sites and the accessibility of these target sites using RNAHybrid and RNAup software. The predicted results that meet the quality filter parameters are further summarized and used to perform a functional analysis of the affected genes using SUPER-FOCUS software. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of the HolomiRA pipeline by applying it to publicly available metagenome-assembled genomes obtained from human feces, as well as from bovine feces and ruminal content. This approach enables the prediction of bacterial genes and biological pathways within microbiomes that could be influenced by host miRNAs. It also allows for the identification of shared or unique miRNAs, target genes, and taxonomies across phenotypes, environments, or host species. HolomiRA is a practical and user-friendly pipeline designed as a hypothesis-generating tool to support the prediction of host miRNA binding sites in prokaryotic genomes, providing insights into host-microbiota communication mediated by miRNA regulation. HolomiRA is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/JBruscadin/HolomiRA .",BMC bioinformatics,2025
41034328,Computational design of an mRNA vaccine targeting antifungal-resistant Lomentospora prolificans.,"Lomentospora prolificans is an emerging opportunistic pathogen that predominantly affects immunocompromised individuals, as well as healthy individuals, often leading to disseminated disease with high mortality rates. Effective treatment is challenging due to its high intrinsic resistance to antifungal agents. To address this, we employed subtractive proteomics and reverse vaccinology approaches to identify potential antigenic proteins for the design of an mRNA-based multi-epitope vaccine (MEV). Our study identified four antigenic proteins as promising vaccine targets. A vaccine construct was developed using a combination of twelve cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), nine helper T lymphocyte (HTL), and five linear B lymphocyte (LBL) epitopes. These epitopes were connected using appropriate linkers (AAY, GPGPG, and KK) and adjuvants to enhance antigenicity and immunogenicity. The vaccine construct was rigorously evaluated for its physicochemical properties, demonstrating high antigenicity, non-toxicity, non-allergenicity, stability, and solubility. Molecular docking studies were conducted to validate the interactions between the vaccine construct and the human toll-like receptor (TLR4). Immune simulation studies further confirmed the vaccine's potential to elicit a robust immune response. Additionally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, principal component analysis (PCA), dynamic cross-correlation matrix (DCCM) analysis, and binding free energy calculations were performed to assess the stability and efficacy of the vaccine-receptor complex. Codon optimization and in-silico cloning were carried out to ensure efficient expression of the vaccine in Escherichia coli strain K12. The findings of this study suggest that the proposed vaccine construct holds significant promise as a novel mRNA-based therapeutic candidate against L. prolificans infections. Further experimental validation is recommended to advance this vaccine toward clinical application.",Scientific reports,2025
41034158,The Genetic Basis of Hippocampal Development.,"The hippocampus is critical for an array of cognitive functions arising from its complex substructure and connectivity. Important insights into hippocampal field specification emerged from classical studies that examined mice lacking particular transcription factors or signaling molecules. Recent high-throughput bioinformatics approaches have led to fresh perspectives on these findings. This review offers a semihistorical timeline of the discovery of the hippocampal organizer and examines the interplay of factors that position this structure. We compare the rich body of literature in the mouse with studies in nonmammalian vertebrates and in human-derived organoid models that reveal commonalities in the mechanisms that induce specific hippocampal fates. We also examine the regulation of neurogenesis versus gliogenesis and the migration of different cell types in the hippocampus. We discuss open questions that arise from discoveries made over the past three decades, and suggest hypotheses or approaches that will expand our understanding of the choreography of hippocampal development.",Annual review of cell and developmental biology,2025
41033896,PTTG1-mediated reprogramming of asparagine metabolism enhances DNA damage repair and leads to compromised antitumor immunity in prostate cancer.,"CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell dysfunction is a key factor in immune escape of prostate cancer (PCa). While pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) exhibits oncogenic effects in multiple cancers, its role in PCa immunoregulation remains unclear. Bioinformatics analysis of TCGA data evaluated PTTG1 expression, prognosis, and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell infiltration. qRT-PCR and western blot (WB) assessed PTTG1 levels in PCa cells. CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell cytotoxicity was measured via LDH release and ELISA (GZMB/TNF-α/IFN-γ). DNA damage was quantified by comet assay and γ-H2AX immunofluorescence. The metabolism of asparagine (Asn) was evaluated by detecting the content of Asn through a kit and the expression of asparagine synthase (ASNS) through WB. A mouse model of allograft tumor was constructed, and the mechanism was verified by immunohistochemistry (PTTG1, ASNS, γ-H2AX, KI67) and flow cytometry detection (proportion of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that PTTG1 was highly expressed in PCa, positively correlated with the poor prognosis of patients, and negatively correlated with CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell infiltration. Cell experiments further demonstrated that PTTG1 inhibited the killing effect of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells on PCa cells. In addition, in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that PTTG1 promoted DNA damage repair (DDR) of PCa by reprogramming Asn, and targeting PTTG1 enhanced the anti-tumor activity of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells. PTTG1 promotes DDR by reprogramming Asn metabolism, thereby inhibiting the function of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells. Targeting PTTG1 can reverse this process, providing a new strategy for PCa immunotherapy.",Urologic oncology,2025

41033653,Molecular signature of early obesity-associated insulin resistance: Adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicle proteins reveal stage-specific candidates for metabolic dysfunction.,"Visceral obesity is closely related to insulin resistance (IR), a key process in developing metabolic diseases. Adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (AdEVs) have emerged as mediators of intercellular communication, carrying signals reflecting adipose tissue's functional state. This study aimed to perform a comparative proteomic analysis of AdEVs to propose a molecular fingerprint of specific biomarker candidates for IR in early-onset obesity. AdEVs were isolated from epididymal adipocytes of 16-week-old male Wistar rats on a high-fat diet (HFD) and controls and analyzed by mass spectrometry coupled to a multi-software protein identification bioinformatics strategy. For relative quantification using the label-free method, more than 1200 proteins were identified, with 431 being overrepresented and unique to HFD, associated explicitly with energy metabolism, cellular stress, and insulin signaling. Based on biological plausibility, and/or the best log2FC and p-value scores, six proteins were proposed as part of the IR molecular fingerprint: Atp5f1b, Anxa6, Myo1c, GLUT4, Anxa5, and Aoc3. Phosphoproteomic analysis revealed key modifications in phosphorylated proteins such as CaATPase (S663), PLIN (S130), and PPM1H (S260,265). The results suggest that AdEVs reflect early mitochondrial alterations related to IR, which could be employed as potential non-invasive biomarker candidates for metabolic dysfunction and follow-up in early overweight or obesity. Significance In this study, we demonstrate that adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (AdEVs) encapsulate a stage-resolved molecular signature that reflects key pathophysiological events underlying the early development of insulin resistance in obesity. These vesicles carry proteins linked to lipotoxicity, mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired vesicular trafficking, offering mechanistic insight into how local adipocyte dysfunction may trigger systemic metabolic impairment. This EV-based proteomic fingerprint advances our understanding of insulin resistance pathogenesis and identifies potential biomarker candidates for early metabolic risk stratification.",Journal of proteomics,2025
41033424,Quercetin from Penthorum chinense Pursh protects against LPS-induced liver inflammation in chickens via suppressing pyroptosis-macrophage polarization crosstalk.,"Penthorum chinense Pursh, a medicinal plant used in traditional Miao medicine, contains a variety of bioactive compounds and is well known for its significant hepatoprotective properties. Quercetin (QUE), one of the most widely investigated hepatoprotective flavonoids derived from P. chinense, has garnered considerable attention owing to its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanisms through which QUE attenuates LPS-induced liver inflammation have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to explore the protective effect of QUE against LPS-induced inflammatory liver injury and to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms. A chicken model of liver inflammation was established via intraperitoneal injection of LPS (1.5 mg/kg). To assess the protective effects of QUE, the compound (10 mg/kg) was administered by oral gavage for six consecutive days prior to LPS challenge. Histopathological and ultrastructural changes in liver tissues were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Oxidative stress markers and antioxidant enzyme activities were also measured in liver tissues. Integrated network pharmacology and bioinformatics analyses were employed to identify core potential targets of QUE. Further validation experiments, including immunofluorescence co-localization, Western blotting, RT-qPCR, and in vitro cell culture assays, were conducted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying QUE mediated attenuation of LPS induced liver inflammation. QUE effectively ameliorated LPS-induced inflammatory liver injury, as evidenced by a significant reduction in hepatic levels of the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA) and a marked increase in the activities of key antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and catalase (CAT). Furthermore, QUE administration significantly downregulated the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins (NLRP3, GSDMD, ASC, and Caspase-1), restored the LPS-induced imbalance in macrophage M1/M2 polarization, and suppressed the expression of chemokines such as CCL4, CCL17, CCL19, and MIF. QUE treatment also significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-18, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6) while upregulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Moreover, QUE markedly inhibited the detrimental crosstalk between LPS-induced pyroptosis and M1 macrophage activation. Integrated network pharmacology and bioinformatics analyses predicted the core targets and pathways involved, and subsequent experimental validation confirmed that QUE attenuates hepatic inflammation primarily through inhibition of the ROS/NLRP3 signaling pathway. This study demonstrates that QUE alleviates LPS-induced liver injury in chickens by suppressing the ROS/NLRP3 pathway, thereby interrupting the pathological crosstalk between pyroptosis and M1 macrophage polarization. These findings offer a promising therapeutic strategy rooted in traditional medicine for the treatment and prevention of inflammatory liver diseases.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,2025
41033415,"Molecular characterization and resistance mechanisms of linezolid-resistant enterococci clinical isolates and identification of a clinical Enterococcus faecium strain co-harboring optrA, poxtA, and cfr(D) in a tertiary hospital in China.","The emergence of linezolid-resistant enterococci has become a significant global health concern. This study aimed to investigate the molecular characterization and resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates in a tertiary hospital in China. The VITEK®2 Compact system, VITEK® MS, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) were used to identify 59 linezolid-resistant enterococci isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were assessed by broth microdilution. WGS and bioinformatics tools analyzed resistance mechanisms and molecular characteristics. Plasmid-borne linezolid resistance gene transfer was assessed via conjugation and transformation assays. We collected 59 linezolid-resistant enterococci isolates, including 54 Enterococcus faecalis and 5 Enterococcus faecium strains. One strain carried the poxtA gene, one isolate carried the G2576T mutation in the 23S rRNA gene, and 56 isolates harbored the optrA gene. Notably, one isolate co-harbored the optrA, poxtA, and cfr(D) genes. Twenty-three sequence types (STs) were identified. ST16 (48.1%, 26/54) predominated in E. faecalis. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and evolutionary analysis indicated that E. faecalis strains of the same ST were genetically related. Among the seven strains (two E. faecium and five E. faecalis strains) selected for further investigation, IS1216E was detected on plasmids carrying linezolid resistance genes in all five strains. Additionally, transposon Tn554 was detected on the chromosome of an optrA-carrying strain. This study describes the molecular characteristics and resistance mechanisms of linezolid-resistant enterococci in our hospital, including a novel E. faecium isolate with optrA, poxtA, and cfr(D), highlighting the need for enhanced surveillance to control the dissemination of resistant strains.",Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,2025
41033098,Momordica charantia small extracellular vesicles mitigate neuronal ferroptosis by inhibition of GPX4 ubiquitination in ischemic stroke.,"Ischemic stroke (IS) is a prevalent cerebrovascular disorder associated with high rates of mortality and long-term disability. Neuronal ferroptosis, characterized by lipid peroxidation, plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of IS-related neurological dysfunction. This study aimed to elucidate the neuroprotective role and mechanisms of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from Momordica charantia (MC-sEVs) in alleviating neuronal ferroptosis after IS. MC-sEVs were isolated using gradient centrifugation and ultracentrifugation and characterized by particle size analysis, morphology observation, and exosomal marker proteins. Small RNA sequencing and lipidomic analysis were also performed to analyze the components of MC-sEVs. Using behavioral tests and a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion, the neuroprotective and anti-ferroptosis role of MC-sEVs was assessed. The oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced HT22 cell model was used to evaluate the anti-ferroptosis effect of MC-sEVs in vitro. Utilizing bioinformatics analysis and molecular docking prediction, Momordica charantia-derived miR-5813b and its downstream target gene, TRIM62, were identified, which was further confirmed using a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. TRIM62-mediated GPX4 ubiquitination was detected by co-immunoprecipitation. The miR5813b mimic and AAV-hsyn-EGFP-miR5813b were both constructed, and their neuroprotective roles were observed in vitro and in vivo. The biosafety of intravenous injection of MC-sEVs was also evaluated. we characterized MC-sEVs which resemble mammalian EVs and are enriched in small non-coding RNAs and lipids. Systemic administration of MC-sEVs significantly attenuated neuronal ferroptosis and promoted neurological recovery in the rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Mechanistically, we identified miR-5813b, a plant-specific microRNA encapsulated within MC-sEVs, as a direct regulator of TRIM62, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that predominantly facilitates K48-linked ubiquitination of GPX4. Knockdown of TRIM62 or transfection with miR-5813b mimics markedly inhibited neuronal ferroptosis in vitro, while inhibition of miR-5813b abrogated the anti-ferroptotic effects of MC-sEVs. Furthermore, overexpression of AAV-hsyn-miR-5813b enhanced post-stroke neurological function in vivo. Importantly, intravenous administration of MC-sEVs demonstrated excellent biosafety. These findings reveal that MC-sEVs derived miR-5813b effectively modulated GPX4 ubiquitination to counteract neuronal ferroptosis after IS. This study highlights MC-sEVs as a promising and biocompatible therapeutic platform for the treatment of IS.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2025
41033082,Therapeutic potential of polysaccharides in inflammation: current insights and future directions.,"Polysaccharides from plants, microorganisms, algae, and animals exhibit significant anti-inflammatory potential, offering safe and effective therapeutic options for diseases like inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis. This review synthesizes their sources, structural modifications, and mechanisms, including modulation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways. In vitro models (e.g., RAW264.7 macrophages, THP-1 cells) demonstrate reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-1β by 30-40 % at doses of 50-200 μg/mL), while in vivo models (e.g., DSS-induced colitis, collagen-induced arthritis) show decreased Disease Activity Index and improved histopathological outcomes at doses of 50-200 mg/kg. Chemical modifications, such as sulfation, enhance bioactivity, though challenges like bioavailability, inconsistent methodologies, and variable dosing persist. A comprehensive Table 3 summarizes sources, compounds, models, doses, and effects, while critical evaluations highlight methodological limitations and propose standardized assays (e.g., ELISA, qPCR).

41033074,Expression of ORMDL1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and its effect on patient outcomes: A potential biomarker and treatment target.,"ORMDL1, a member of the ORMDL protein family, is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein. Abnormal expression of ORMDL1 in various types of human cancers has attracted much attention in recent years. However, the function of ORMDL1 in ESCC has not been reported. The present study was the first to report that ORMDL1 can serve as a useful prognostic marker in ESCC. The methods used to assess the role of ORMDL1 in predicting the prognosis of ESCC were mainly bioinformatics analysis, WB and Immunohistochemistry. The abnormal expression of ORMDL1 in various types of cancers was determined using data from TCGA and GEO databases. In ESCC, we found that the expression level of ORMDL1 was significantly higher in tumor tissues than that in normal esophageal tissues (p < 0.001). The association between high level of ORMDL1 expression and poor prognosis was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed on both TCGA and our own samples to determine whether ORMDL1 is an independent prognostic factor for ESCC. Moreover, analysis of immune infiltration showed a significant connection between ORMDL1 expression and various immune cell subtypes, including T helper cells and neutrophils, underscoring its potential as a biomarker for poor prognosis. Western blot analysis further validated that the expression levels of ORMDL1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues and cell lines are significantly greater compared to those in normal esophageal tissues and epithelial cell lines. This finding aligns with the outcomes observed in database analyses. By integrating multi-omics data with experimental findings from clinical samples, we hypothesize that ORMDL1 may contribute to the initiation and advancement of ESCC. Its elevated expression is not only associated with unfavorable prognosis but may also be involved in tumor immune evasion through its impact on the tumor immune microenvironment. Consequently, ORMDL1 has the potential to act as a promising molecular biomarker for diagnosing and assessing prognosis in ESCC, offering new avenues for research and targets for personalized therapies for ESCC.",Translational oncology,2025
41032923,Bioinformatic-based study to investigate the fluctuations and performance of MYD88 and GRB2 gene expression in gastric cancer; Can they be considered diagnostic biomarkers?,"Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fourth most prevalent malignancy and constitutes the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally. The elevated mortality rate is linked to molecular heterogeneity, late-stage diagnosis, and the limited efficacy of existing therapies. Recent developments in bioinformatics have facilitated the discovery of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets, essential for enhancing diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment approaches in gastric cancer. This study examines the bioinformatics analysis of two significant genes, GRB2 (Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) and MYD88 (Myeloid differentiation primary response 88), associated with gastric cancer progression and immune response regulation. We analyzed data from public databases such as GEPIA2, TIMER, GeneMANIA, and Cytoscape to examine the differential expression of GRB2 and MYD88 in gastric cancer tissues versus normal tissues, their roles in protein-protein interaction networks, and their association with immune infiltration. The findings indicate that elevated GRB2 expression correlates significantly with tumor invasion, underscoring its potential as an independent prognostic marker and therapeutic target in gastric cancer. The expression of MYD88 is associated with the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is induced by Helicobacter pylori infection, thereby contributing to chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis. Functional enrichment analysis, encompassing KEGG and GO, indicated that both genes are involved in essential oncogenic pathways, such as cell proliferation, immune response regulation, and inflammatory signaling. The results indicate that GRB2 and MYD88 may function as significant biomarkers for patient stratification and should be considered in the formulation of targeted therapies for gastric cancer. This study highlights the importance of GRB2 and MYD88 in the progression of gastric cancer and proposes their potential as therapeutic targets to enhance patient outcomes.",Cancer treatment and research communications,2025

Using a hybrid sequencing approach that combines short- and long-read technologies, we assembled high-quality genomes of the only two available contemporary <i>Xcb</i> strains. Furthermore, we reconstructed the first historical genome of <i>Xcb</i> from a herbarium specimen collected in 1848, thereby extending the documented presence of this overlooked disease in India by nearly 100 years. We then characterized the genomic features of these strains, with a particular emphasis on virulence factors and plasmid content, using a suite of specialized bioinformatics tools. The contemporary <i>Xcb</i> strains were found to carry between one and four plasmids, which varied in their mobility potential (conjugative, mobilizable, or non-mobile). A total of 30 to 32 type III effector (T3E) genes were identified across chromosomes and plasmids. Notably, one of the contemporary strains harbored four plasmid-borne transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), which showed only distant similarity to TALEs found in <i>X. citri</i> pv. <i>citri</i>, a globally major pathogen with a partially overlapping host range. Comparative genomic analysis between the contemporary and historical strains revealed a remarkable conservation of effector gene content, indicating that key pathogenic traits may have been acquired early in <i>Xcb</i>'s evolutionary history. Collectively, these new genomic resources provide valuable insights into the biology and evolution of this underexplored bacterial pathogen.",Phytopathology,2025

The <i>Boesenbergia rotunda</i> rhizome was extracted using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) with ethanol solvent, and the active compound was identified using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Drug-likeness, bioactivity, and membrane permeability were used to select active compounds with high potential for anti-breast cancer effects. Molecular docking and dynamic simulations were performed to study the interactions between active compounds and target proteins. The ethanol extract contained various active compounds, predominantly flavonoids, with pinostrobin being the most abundant (24.061%). Six compounds (chrysin, pinostrobin, pinocembrin, formononetin, desmethoxyyangonin, and zearalenone) showed the highest potential as anti-breast cancer agents, targeting proliferation-related and angiogenesis-associated proteins (CDK1, JAK3, ADORA1, PI3K, MMP13, VEGFR1). These findings suggest that <i>Boesenbergia rotunda</i> ethanol extract has promising anti-breast cancer capabilities by inhibiting proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumour invasion.",Natural product research,2025
41032481,A blueprint of synergistic effect in Crataegus pinnatifida and obesity-related gut microbiota against obesity via systems biology concept.,"Current obesity treatments include behavioral interventions, pharmacotherapy and surgery. Recently, the combination of 'medicinal food' products such as the plant Crataegus pinnatifida and its interaction with the gut microbiota has shown promise as an alternative therapeutic strategy to treat obesity. We obtained secondary metabolites (SMs) of obesity-related gut microbiota and Crataegus pinnatifida from gutMGene database and NAPSS database. bioinformatics analysis was used to elucidate key target and signaling pathways, whereas molecular docking (MD), molecular dynamics simulation and quantum chemical calculations identified crucial SMs involved in these pathways. The toxicity and physicochemical properties of these SMs were also assessed. Phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), a key mediator in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/ Protein Kinase B (Akt) pathway that is crucial for regulating insulin signaling and adipogenesis, emerged as the central hub within the PPI network. Strong binders to PIK3R1 were predicted to be quercetin, kaempferol and naringenin chalcone, suggesting their potential as therapeutic agents to treat obesity. The synergistic combination of Crataegus pinnatifida and the obesity-related gut microbiota holds promise as a novel therapeutic strategy for obesity by targeting PIK3R1 and modulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Further experimental validation is necessary to confirm these findings.",PloS one,2025
41032464,Molecular Insights into Bismuth's New Applications against Antimicrobial Resistance and Coronaviruses.,"ConspectusBismuth, a heavy metal distinguished by its low toxicity, compared to lead or mercury, has long been associated with medicine for the treatment of various conditions, notably as a key component in triple and quadruple therapies for eradicating <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, including antibiotic-resistant strains. Compounds such as bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) and colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS) enhance the efficacy of antibiotics, e.g., metronidazole and tetracycline. Over the past two decades, the knowledge on the molecular mechanism of action of bismuth drugs has been significantly advanced, in particular with the aid of the metallomics/metalloproteomics, facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic applications beyond <i>H. pylori</i> eradication.This Account describes how the molecular mechanism of action of bismuth drugs was unveiled at a system level by multiple-metalloproteomics approaches, which enable the comprehensive identification of bismuth-binding proteins with diverse affinities in bacteria. By integration with other techniques such as proteomics, bioinformatics and molecular biology, the sustained efficacy of bismuth drugs was attributable to their capacities to disrupt multiple biological pathways through binding and functional perturbation of key enzymes, in particular, those enzymes bearing C<i>X</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>C (<i>n</i> = 2, 7), C<i>X</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>H (<i>n</i> = 5, 6) and H<i>X</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>H (<i>n</i> = 0-2, 8) motifs, in consistence with the thiophilic nature and high acidic property of bismuth.The generated knowledge on the mode of action of bismuth drugs lays a solid foundation for further exploration of their novel therapeutic applications. Our extensive studies have revealed that bismuth drugs and compounds hold great potential as versatile agents in combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis through co-therapies with clinically used antibiotics. This includes bismuth drugs as broad-spectrum inhibitors of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs), enzymes responsible for resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, to fight against MBLs-positive bacterial infection together with β-lactams; bismuth drugs serve as adjuvants of Cefiderocol (Fetroja), the only clinically approved sideromycin, against infections caused by multidrug-resistant <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i>; bismuth drugs (and relevant compounds) in combination with clinically used antibiotics could combat <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infections by disrupting iron homeostasis and functionally impairing Fe-S cluster-containing enzymes in multidrug-resistant <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa;</i> newly developed bismuth compounds serve as novel metalloantibiotics to combat AMR. Moreover, the ability of bismuth to disrupt key zinc finger proteins for the transcription and replication in coronavirus rendered its new potential in treating coronavirus infections, particularly SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Combining clinically used bismuth drugs with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a thiol-containing drug, increases bismuth uptake in blood plasma to therapeutic levels for SARS-CoV-2 without apparent toxicity. Bismuth drugs, therefore, hold great potential for the treatment of viral infections.We anticipate that our mechanism-guided discoveries of bismuth's new therapeutic applications are poised to inspire researchers in relevant fields to rationally design drugs (and metallodrugs) and repurpose FDA-approved drugs, ultimately leading to the development of new effective therapeutics for combating emerging infectious diseases, which will positively impact human health and well-being.",Accounts of chemical research,2025

41032040,SOX4-Mediated Post-Transcriptional suppression of PTEN via miR-106b~25 Cluster Contributes to Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness.,"Molecular based risk stratification of prostate cancer (PCa) holds significant potential for guiding precision therapeutic strategies. Previous studies revealed SOX4 activation drives PCa progression in PTEN deficient tumors through the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. However, the mechanistic interplay between SOX4 and PTEN, as well as their clinical utility for prognostic stratification, remains to be elucidated. In this study, we revealed that SOX4 expression is increased in PCa patients with low PTEN levels, and the expression of SOX4 and PTEN is inversely correlated in PCa patients. Importantly, PCa patients exhibiting SOX4-high/PTEN-low (SOX4+/PTEN-) expression represent an aggressive PCa subtype associated with unfavorable prognosis. Mechanistically, we found that SOX4 downregulates PTEN protein expression at the post-transcriptional level. Through high-throughput microRNA profiling and bioinformatics analysis, we identified that SOX4 transcriptionally activates the expression of miR-106b∼25 cluster, which directly targets PTEN. Furthermore, SOX4 overexpression combined with PTEN deficiency leads hyperactivation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Importantly, dual targeting of SOX4 and PI3K-AKT signaling effectively suppresses PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vivo and in vitro. These data establish a novel SOX4/miR-106b~25/PTEN pathway model in promoting PCa progression and propose a potential therapeutic strategy for this high-risk subtype. Implications: SOX4 suppresses PTEN through the transcriptional upregulation of miR-106b~25, rendering tumors sensitive to combined inhibition of SOX4 and PI3K-AKT in prostate cancer.",Molecular cancer research : MCR,2025
41031899,Multi-omics data integration for topology-based pathway activation assessment and personalized drug ranking.,"Although multi-omics analysis is popular for revealing diverse physiological effects and biomarkers in many branches of state-of-the-art molecular and cell biology and bioinformatics, there is still no consensus on a gold standard protocol for the integration of various multi-omics profiles into a uniformly shaped system bioinformatics platform. In the current study, we performed the integration of data on DNA methylation, and the expression of coding RNA (mRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA), and long non-coding RNA into a joint platform for calculation of signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) and drug efficiency index (DEI). We found that the mirrored and balanced DEI values fitted the DNA methylome data better than the original DEI. Additionally, the protein-coding mRNA-based values correlated more strongly with antisense lncRNA-based values than with miRNA-based values. The whole correlation between the mRNA-based and antisense lncRNA-based values was generally positive. This platform allowed integrative analysis of several levels of gene expression regulation of protein-coding genes and their regulators, including methylation and noncoding RNAs.",Molecular omics,2025
41031896,Circadian rhythmicity and biopsychosocial characteristics influence opioid use in chronic low back pain.,"BACKGROUNDInter- and intraindividual fluctuations in pain intensity pose a major challenge to treatment efficacy, with a majority of people perceiving their pain relief as inadequate. Recent preclinical studies have identified circadian rhythmicity as a potential contributor to these fluctuations and a therapeutic target.METHODSWe therefore sought to determine the impact of circadian rhythms in people with chronic low back pain (CLBP) through a detailed characterization, including questionnaires to evaluate biopsychosocial characteristics, ecological momentary assessment (7 day e-diaries at 8:00/14:00/20:00) to observe pain fluctuations, and intraday blood transcriptomics (at 8:00/20:00) to identify genes/pathways of interest.RESULTSWhile most individuals displayed constant or variable/mixed pain phenotypes, a distinct subset had daily fluctuations of increasing pain scores (>30% change in intensity over 12 hours in ≥4/7 days). This population had no opioid users, better biopsychosocial profiles, and differentially expressed transcripts relative to other pain phenotypes. The circadian-governed neutrophil degranulation pathway was particularly enriched among arrhythmic individuals; the link between neutrophil degranulation and opioid use was further confirmed in a separate CLBP cohort.CONCLUSIONOur findings identified pain rhythmicity and the circadian expression of neutrophil degranulation pathways as indicators of CLBP outcomes, which may help provide a personalized approach to phenotyping biopsychosocial characteristics and medication use. This highlights the need to better understand the impact of circadian rhythmicity across chronic pain conditions.FUNDINGThis work was funded by grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR; grant PJT-190170, to NG and MGP) and the CIHR-Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research Chronic Pain Network (grant SCA-145102, to NG, QD, LD, MGP, and MC).

41031848,Characterization of the bacterial and fungal diversity in habitats of Corsica Island.,"Indoor environments may impact human health significantly since microbial diversity made of various bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms constitutes the habitat's microbiome. These microorganisms originate from diverse sources, such as the environment, humans, and pets. Understanding such microbial diversity is crucial for assessing related health impacts. The aim of this study was to investigate bacterial and fungal microorganisms from different surfaces in a set of houses on Corsica Island (southeastern France). We conducted sampling and high-throughput sequencing of PCR-amplified microbial DNA from 40 habitats (eight different surfaces tested for each) located on diverse regions of the island. Following nucleic acid recovery, we performed PCR targeting V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA for bacteria and ITS1 region for fungi. Bioinformatics processing allowed the identification of distinct microbial species and the analysis of their distribution. Our findings highlighted that the most represented bacterial genera in the Corsican homes tested were <i>Ralstonia</i> (16.9%), <i>Staphylococcus</i> (4.8%), <i>Corynebacterium</i> (2.7%), <i>Enhydrobacter</i> (6.8%), and <i>Methylorubrum</i> (6.0%). Regarding fungal diversity, the most common genera identified were <i>Dipodascaceae</i> (21.6%), <i>Rhodotorula</i> (10.9%), <i>Aspergillus</i> (8.9%), <i>Clavispora</i> (7.3%), and <i>Candida</i> (6.8%). Our results also showed differences in microbial composition among the habitats studied, while a higher bacterial and fungal diversity was observed in rural habitats and in those with pets.IMPORTANCEThis study provides valuable insights into the microbial diversity present in indoor environments of Corsican homes, specifically highlighting bacterial and fungal communities on various household surfaces. By identifying the predominant microbial genera and revealing differences linked to habitat characteristics, such as rural settings and pet ownership, this research enhances our understanding of how indoor microbial communities vary.",Applied and environmental microbiology,2025
41031828,MEIS2 Modulates Oxidative Phosphorylation and ROS Generation to Affect CD8<sup>+</sup> T Cell Antitumor Immunity in Prostate Cancer.,"The response of prostate cancer (PCa) to immunotherapy remains suboptimal. Although MEIS homeobox 2 (MEIS2) has been shown to delay the malignant progression of PCa by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, promoting DNA damage, and affecting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune surveillance, its role in immune regulation and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. MEIS2 expression in PCa and its correlation with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were characterized using bioinformatics analysis and cell experiments. Using qPCR, flow cytometry, and ELISA, the impact of MEIS2 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell antitumor immunity was assessed. To delineate the role of MEIS2 in oxidative phosphorylation and ROS generation, OCR, ATP, and ROS measurements were collected. Finally, the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor MCH32 was introduced and rescue experiments were conducted to elucidate the mechanism by which MEIS2 regulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cytotoxicity. MEIS2 expression in PCa was found to be downregulated, positively correlating with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration. Functionally, MEIS2 overexpression enhanced the cytotoxicity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Mechanistically, MEIS2 was notably enriched in oxidative phosphorylation and ROS pathways. Knockdown of MEIS2 in cancer cells stimulated oxidative phosphorylation and ROS production, which impaired CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell antitumor immunity. Treatment with the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor MCH32 reversed these effects induced by MEIS2 knockdown. Targeting MEIS2 could represent a clinically relevant approach to enhancing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell antitumor efficacy in PCa, our findings indicate.",The Prostate,2025
41031557,A new diagnostic service for rare (neurologic) diseases in West-Hungary.,"Genetic services have not been evenly distributed in Hungary.

41031545,RSV-Induced Glutaric Acid Modulates Neuronal Mitochondrial Heterogeneity via the Lung-Brain Axis.,"The study was designed to explore how glutaric acid induced by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection affects nerve cell mitochondrial heteroplasmy. An RSV infection animal model was established, and lung tissues were collected after 7 days for metabolomic analysis. Then, a neuroinflammatory cell model was constructed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The CCK8 assay detected proliferation, the DCFH-DA probe assessed reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and ELISA measured IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, and IFN-γ levels in HT-22 cells. RT-qPCR detected Drp1 and Mfn2 expression levels to study the mechanism of glutaric acid-exacerbated neuroinflammation. Immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR detected the effects of glutaric acid on neuron biomarkers in the lung (PGP9.5) and brain (NeuN). Bioinformatics screened glutaric acid-interacting proteins, and the enzymatic activities of NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase (NAD-ME) were validated at cellular and animal levels. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detected glutaric acid content in blood and brain tissues. After glutaric acid treatment, Drp1 protein expression increased, Mfn2 decreased, and ROS, IL-1, and IL-6 cytokine levels rose significantly. Glutaric acid affects the central nervous system by disrupting the lung neural network, causing mitochondrial homeostasis dysregulation. Its interaction with NAD-ME accelerates mitochondrial imbalance. Glutaric acid induced by RSV infection aggravates neuroinflammation by affecting nerve cell mitochondrial homeostasis via the lung-brain axis. These findings offer new insights into RSV-induced neuroinflammation and potential targets for neuroprotective strategies.",Journal of medical virology,2025
41031498,"Mechanistic Insights into Shenfu Injection for COVID-19-Induced ARDS: A Combined Analysis of GEO Database, Network Pharmacology, and Molecular Docking.","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe and life-threatening complication of COVID-19, for which no specific antiviral treatment currently exists. Shenfu Injection (SFI), a traditional Chinese medicine formulation, has shown clinical promise in improving respiratory function and reducing mortality in ARDS patients. However, its underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. A combined network pharmacology and bioinformatics approach was used to elucidate the potential mechanisms of SFI against COVID-19-induced ARDS. SFI-related targets were identified through multiple public databases, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. Gene expression data from GEO datasets (GSE171110 and GSE273149) were used to identify differentially expressed genes in COVID-19-induced ARDS, which were then intersected with SFI targets. Molecular docking was performed to evaluate the binding affinities between major active compounds in SFI and core viral proteins, including 3CLpro, RdRp, and ACE2. A total of 398 SFI-associated targets were identified, with key targets including SRC, MAPK1, MAPK3, PIK3R1, and STAT3. Active compounds such as Gomisin B, Deoxyharringtonine, Ginsenoside-Rh4_qt, Suchilactone, and Celabenzine were highlighted. Enrichment analyses identified 2,883 GO terms and 219 KEGG pathways (P < 0.05), primarily involving the PI3K-Akt, MAPK, TNF, NF-κB, and apoptosis signaling pathways. GEO data analysis confirmed the involvement of these pathways in COVID-19-induced ARDS. Molecular docking showed strong binding affinities, particularly between Ginsenoside-Rh4_qt and 3CLpro/ACE2, and Celabenzine with RdRp. The findings suggest that SFI exerts therapeutic effects through modulation of key inflammatory and immune pathways and by direct interaction with SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. This multi-target mechanism aligns with the pharmacological characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine. However, further experimental validation is required to confirm these computational predictions and assess clinical relevance. This study provides mechanistic insights into how SFI may alleviate COVID-19-induced ARDS via modulation of critical signaling pathways and interaction with viral targets, offering a theoretical foundation for its clinical application in the management of severe COVID-19 cases.",Infectious disorders drug targets,2025
41031489,TGx-DDI (Toxicogenomic DNA Damage-Inducing) Biomarker Validation: Multi-Site Ring Trial Supporting Regulatory Use.,"Standard in vitro genotoxicity assays often suffer from low specificity, leading to irrelevant positive findings that require costly in vivo follow-up studies. The TGx-DDI (Toxicogenomic DNA Damage-Inducing) transcriptomic biomarker was developed to address this limitation by identifying DNA damage-inducing compounds through gene expression profiling in human TK6 lymphoblastoid cells. To qualify TGx-DDI as a reliable, reproducible biomarker for augmenting genotoxicity hazard assessment, a multi-site ring-trial was conducted across four laboratories using 14 blinded test compounds and standardized protocols. TK6 cells were exposed to three concentrations of each compound, followed by RNA extraction and digital nucleic acid counting using the NanoString nCounter® platform. A three-pronged bioinformatics approach-Nearest Shrunken Centroid Probability Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, and Hierarchical Clustering-was used to assign DDI or non-DDI classifications. TGx-DDI demonstrated 100% sensitivity, 86% specificity, and 91% accuracy in distinguishing DDI from non-DDI compounds under validated test conditions. High inter-laboratory concordance was observed (agreement coefficients ≥ 0.61), and transcriptomic data showed strong cross-site correlation (Pearson r > 0.84). The biomarker reproducibly classified test agents even when conducted across study sites. These results demonstrate that TGx-DDI is a robust and reproducible transcriptomic biomarker that enhances the specificity of genotoxicity testing by distinguishing biologically relevant DNA damage responses. Its integration into genotoxicity testing strategies can support regulatory decision-making, reduce unnecessary animal use, and improve the assessment of human health risks.",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,2025
41031368,Mechanism of spindle stability and poleward flux regulating spindle length during the metaphase.,"During metaphase, the spindle stabilizes chromosomes and maintains its size despite continuous microtubule poleward flux. To investigate the mechanism of the spindle stability and how the poleward flux regulates the spindle size, we establish a minimal spindle model that incorporates kinetochores, microtubules, spindle poles, and microtubule sliding proteins such as kinesin-5, microtubule depolymerizing proteins such as kinesin-13, and microtubule crosslinking proteins such as NuMA. We find that the poleward flux stabilizes the spindle by regulating the spindle length and the length of antiparallel microtubule overlaps to achieve equal rates of microtubule sliding, plus-end polymerization, and minus-end depolymerization. We reveal the underlying mechanism of how the poleward flux rate scales linearly with the spindle length and microtubule overlap length in small cells and how microtubule nucleation affects spindle dynamics in large cells.",iScience,2025

41031251,Restoring Tamoxifen Sensitivity in Breast Cancer: The Role of lncRNA MALAT1 and NanoCurcumin as Modulators of Drug Resistance.,"<b>Background:</b> Tamoxifen resistance remains a major clinical challenge in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, contributing to recurrence and poor prognosis. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), including MALAT1, UCA1, CYTOR, GAS5, and HOTAIR, have emerged as key regulators of endocrine resistance. Curcumin, a polyphenol with anticancer properties, modulates lncRNA expression, and its bioavailable formulation, NanoCurcumin, enhances therapeutic efficacy. This study evaluates the effects of NanoCurcumin in combination with tamoxifen on lncRNA expression and resistance mechanisms in ER+ breast cancer. <b>Methods:</b> Plasma levels of the selected lncRNAs were assessed via qRT-PCR in luminal breast cancer patients receiving tamoxifen alone or in combination with NanoCurcumin oral soft gels for 6 months. Bioinformatics analysis of MALAT1 expression was performed using the GEO database. In vitro, MALAT1 expression was evaluated in breast cancer (MCF7) and normal breast (MCF10) cell lines via qRT-PCR. Tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 cells were generated through prolonged treatment, and the effects of NanoCurcumin on MALAT1 expression were analyzed over 4 months. <b>Results:</b> In clinical samples, NanoCurcumin significantly reduced MALAT1 expression (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and trended toward decreased UCA1, CYTOR, and HOTAIR while increasing GAS5 expression. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed MALAT1 upregulation in tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. In vitro, MALAT1 was significantly elevated in MCF7 cells compared to MCF10 and increased over time with tamoxifen treatment alone. NanoCurcumin reversed this trend, sustaining low MALAT1 levels and mitigating resistance. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that NanoCurcumin mitigates tamoxifen resistance by downregulating MALAT1, offering a novel epigenetic strategy to enhance endocrine therapy efficacy. Further studies should explore lncRNA-targeted interventions to improve treatment outcomes in ER+ breast cancer.",BioMed research international,2025
41031220,An Integrative Analysis Identified Six Genes That Regulate the Development of Atherosclerosis Through Autophagy.,"<b>Background:</b> Autophagy exerts a vital role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Mounting evidence suggests a significant link between autophagy and atherosclerosis. <b>Methods:</b> Two atherosclerotic plaque datasets were integrated from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined, enrichment analyses were subsequently performed on DEGs. We employed weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) and cross-linked these modules with DEGs and autophagy-related genes. Subsequently, a prediction model was established for evaluation. RT-PCR was adopted to identify hub gene expression. The consensus clustering analysis on the overlapping genes was executed. Evaluation of immune infiltration was conducted on the merged dataset. A TF-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was then established for the hub genes. <b>Results:</b> The differential gene expression analysis uncovered 259 DEGs. Enrichment analysis showed that immune and inflammatory reactions were related to atherosclerosis. By intersecting DEGs, WGCNA module genes, and ARGs, 13 overlapping genes were obtained. Four machine learning models identified seven hub genes. Furthermore, six of the seven genes demonstrated potential for disease diagnosis. The prediction model, based on the expression levels of these six genes, yielded satisfactory results. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the mRNA expression of six genes meets expectations. Consensus clustering divides 13 overlapping genes into two clusters, C1 and C2, with significant differences in immune infiltration. Immune cell infiltration demonstrated heightened immune activity within the atherosclerotic plaque group. A TF-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was established for the six genes. <b>Conclusion:</b> It is anticipated that these six genes may serve as significant and valuable targets for future research into atherosclerosis.",International journal of genomics,2025
41031110,Development and performance evaluation of a clinical metagenomics approach for identifying pathogens in the whole blood from patients with undifferentiated fever.,"Blood culture is the cornerstone of microbiological diagnostics for patients with acute undifferentiated fever and no obvious localization of infection; however, up to 50% of cases remain undiagnosed. Infections caused by arboviruses, fastidious or even uncultivable bacteria, or parasites often go undiagnosed without the use of target-specific molecular methods. These are typically performed in a stepwise manner, increasing cost and delaying results. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has recently gained recognition as a potential universal pathogen detection tool for such cases. Our study aimed to develop a streamlined mNGS workflow for simultaneous detection of intracellular and cell-free pathogens within a single sequencing library. Total nucleic acid was isolated separately from 200 EDTA blood samples. The plasma isolate was processed with DNase, followed by the depletion of host ribosomal and messenger RNA, reverse transcription, and sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA). The whole blood isolate was only reverse transcribed, with no other pre-processing manipulation. Finally, the two fractions were combined prior to library preparation and sequencing using either Oxford Nanopore Technologies or Illumina. Following established bioinformatics analysis, we developed a mathematical ranking approach (ClinSeq score) that enabled quick identification of relevant pathogens in approximately one hour. The mNGS workflow reached 79.5% (159/200) overall sensitivity. For bacteria the sensitivity was 88.6% (70/79), DNA viruses, 66.7% (10/15) and for RNA viruses 73.8% (76/103). Pathogen detections by individual sequencing methods showed overall sensitivity of Illumina and ONT to be 80.0% (76/95) and 79.1% (83/105) respectively. The ClinSeq score correctly highlighted the pathogen in 126/200 (63.0%) samples effectively with a Cohen's kappa (<i>κ</i>) agreement of 0.61 with manual analysis. Developed comprehensive mNGS workflow detects a wide range of pathogens in patients with acute undifferentiated fever. The unified workflow improves sensitivity for intracellular bacteria and RNA viruses, reduces time, cost and complexity by eliminating the need for separate library preparations, enabling faster turnaround suitable for clinical settings. The ClinSeq score effectively differentiates true pathogen signals from background noise, reducing false positives and manual interpretation time. Overall, the workflow demonstrates flexible, and efficient pathogen detection, supporting its potential for clinical diagnostics and improved patient management.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2025
41030939,Molecular Heterogeneity in Early-Onset Colorectal Cancer: Pathway-Specific Insights in High-Risk Populations.,"The incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), defined as diagnosis before age 50, has been rising at an alarming rate, with Hispanic/Latino (H/L) individuals experiencing the most significant increases in both incidence and mortality. Despite this growing public health concern, the molecular mechanisms driving EOCRC disparities remain poorly understood. Oncogenic pathways such as WNT, TGF-beta, and RTK/RAS are critical in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, yet their specific roles in EOCRC across diverse populations have not been extensively studied. This research seeks to identify molecular alterations within these pathways by comparing EOCRC cases in H/L and non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals. Furthermore, we explore the clinical significance of these findings to inform precision medicine strategies tailored to high-risk populations. To investigate mutation frequencies in genes associated with the WNT, TGF-beta, and RTK/RAS pathways, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis using publicly available CRC datasets. The study cohort consisted of 3,412 patients, including 302 H/L and 3,110 NHW individuals. Patients were categorized based on age (EOCRC: <50 years; late-onset CRC [LOCRC]: ≥50 years) and population group (H/L vs. NHW) to assess variations in mutation prevalence. Statistical comparisons of mutation rates between groups were conducted using chi-squared tests, while Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was employed to evaluate overall survival differences associated with pathway alterations. Notable molecular distinctions in the RTK/RAS pathway were identified between EOCRC and LOCRC among H/L patients, with EOCRC exhibiting a lower frequency of RTK/RAS alterations compared to LOCRC (66.7% vs. 79.3%, p = 0.01). Within this pathway, mutations in CBL (p < 0.05) and NF1 (p < 0.05) were significantly more prevalent in EOCRC cases (5.8% vs. 1.2% and 11.6% vs. 3.7%, respectively), whereas BRAF mutations were notably less frequent in EOCRC than in LOCRC (5.1% vs. 18.3%, p < 0.05). Comparisons between EOCRC patients from H/L and NHW populations revealed distinct pathway-specific alterations that were more common in H/L individuals. These included RNF43 mutations (12.3% vs. 6.7%, p < 0.05) in the WNT pathway, BMPR1A mutations (5.1% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.05) in the TGF-beta pathway, and multiple RTK/RAS pathway alterations, such as MAPK3 (3.6% vs. 0.7%, p < 0.05), CBL (5.8% vs. 1.4%, p < 0.05), and NF1 (11.6% vs. 6.1%, p < 0.05). Survival analysis in H/L EOCRC patients did not reveal statistically significant differences based on pathway alterations. However, in NHW EOCRC patients, the presence of WNT pathway alterations was associated with significantly improved survival outcomes, suggesting potential ethnicity-specific prognostic implications. This study highlights the substantial molecular heterogeneity present in EOCRC, particularly among high-risk populations. H/L EOCRC patients exhibited distinct genetic alterations, with a higher prevalence of CBL, NF1, RNF43, BMPR1A, and MAPK3 mutations compared to their NHW counterparts. Additionally, RTK/RAS pathway alterations were less frequent in EOCRC than in LOCRC. Despite these molecular differences, pathway alterations did not significantly impact survival outcomes in H/L EOCRC patients. However, in NHW EOCRC patients, the presence of WNT pathway alterations was associated with improved survival. These findings emphasize the necessity for further research to clarify the molecular mechanisms driving EOCRC disparities in high-risk populations and to inform precision medicine strategies for underrepresented groups.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025
41030937,Ethnicity-Specific Molecular Alterations in MAPK and JAK/STAT Pathways in Early-Onset Colorectal Cancer.,"Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), defined as colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosed before the age of 50, has been increasing in incidence, particularly among Hispanic/Latino (H/L) populations. Despite this trend, the underlying molecular mechanisms driving EOCRC disparities remain poorly understood. The MAPK and JAK/STAT pathways play critical roles in tumor progression, proliferation, and treatment response; however, their involvement in ethnicity-specific differences in EOCRC remains unclear. This study aims to characterize molecular alterations in MAPK and JAK/STAT pathway genes among EOCRC patients, focusing on differences between H/L and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients. Additionally, we assess whether these pathway-specific alterations contribute to survival outcomes in H/L EOCRC patients. We conducted a bioinformatics analysis using publicly available CRC datasets to assess mutation frequencies in MAPK and JAK/STAT pathway genes. A total of 3,412 patients were included in the study, comprising 302 H/L patients and 3,110 NHW patients. Patients were stratified by age (EOCRC: <50 years, late-onset colorectal cancer -LOCRC: ≥50 years) and ethnicity (H/L vs. NHW) to evaluate differences in mutation prevalence. Chi-squared tests were performed to compare mutation rates between groups, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess overall survival differences based on pathway alterations among both H/L and NHW EOCRC patients. Significant differences were observed in MAPK pathway-related genes when comparing EOCRC and LOCRC in H/L patients. NF1 (11.6% vs. 3.7%, p = 0.01), ACVR1 (2.9% vs. 0%, p = 0.04), and MAP2K1 (3.6% vs. 0%, p = 0.01) were more prevalent in EOCRC, while BRAF mutations (18.3% vs. 5.1%, p = 9.1e-4) were significantly more frequent in LOCRC among H/L patients. Additionally, when comparing EOCRC in H/L patients to EOCRC in NHW patients, key MAPK pathway genes such as AKT1 (5.1% vs. 1.8%, p = 0.03), MAPK3 (3.6% vs. 0.7%, p = 6.83e-3), NF1 (11.6% vs. 6.1%, p = 0.02), and PDGFRB (5.8% vs. 2.1%, p = 0.02) were significantly enriched in H/L EOCRC patients.However, no significant differences were observed in JAK/STAT pathway-related genes when comparing EOCRC and LOCRC in H/L patients, nor when comparing EOCRC in H/L vs. NHW patients. Survival analysis revealed borderline significant differences in H/L EOCRC patients, whereas NHW EOCRC patients with no alterations in the JAK/STAT pathway exhibited significant survival differences. In contrast, MAPK pathway alterations were not associated with significant survival differences. These findings suggest that MAPK and JAK/STAT pathway disruptions may have distinct prognostic implications in H/L EOCRC patients, justifying further investigation into their potential role in cancer progression and treatment response. These findings suggest that MAPK pathway dysregulation plays a distinct role in EOCRC among H/L patients, potentially contributing to disparities in CRC development and treatment response. The higher prevalence of MAPK alterations in H/L EOCRC patients compared to NHW patients underscores the need to explore ethnic-specific tumor biology and therapeutic targets. Conversely, the lack of significant differences in JAK/STAT pathway alterations suggests that this pathway may not play a major differential role in EOCRC vs. LOCRC within this population. Survival analysis highlighted the prognostic relevance of pathway-specific disruptions. These insights emphasize the importance of precision medicine approaches that consider genetic heterogeneity and pathway-specific alterations to improve outcomes for H/L CRC patients.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025

However, genomic studies focusing on Hispanic/Latino (H/L) populations remain scarce, limiting our understanding of ethnicity-specific molecular alterations. This study aims to characterize pathway-specific mutations in TP53, WNT, PI3K, TGF-Beta and RTK/RAS signaling pathways in GC and compare mutation frequencies between H/L and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of these alterations on overall survival using publicly available datasets. We conducted a bioinformatics analysis using publicly available GC datasets to assess mutation frequencies in TP53, WNT, PI3K, TGF-Beta and RTK/RAS pathway genes.

Patients were stratified by ethnicity (H/L vs. NHW) to evaluate differences in mutation prevalence. Chi-squared tests were performed to compare mutation rates between groups, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess overall survival differences based on pathway alterations among both H/L and NHW patients. Significant differences were observed in the TP53 pathway and related genes when comparing GC in H/L patients to NHW patients. TP53 mutations were less prevalent in H/L patients (9.6% vs. 19%, p = 0.03). Borderline significant differences were noted in the WNT pathway when comparing GC in H/L patients to NHW GC patients, with WNT alterations more frequent in H/L GC (8.4% vs. 4%, p = 0.08), and APC mutations significantly higher (3.6% vs. 0.8%, p = 0.05). Although alterations in PI3K, TGF-Beta and RTK/RAS pathways were not statistically significant, borderline significance was observed in genes related to these pathways, including EGFR (p = 0.07), FGFR1 (p = 0.05), FGFR2 (p = 0.05), and PTPN11 (p = 0.05) in the PI3K pathway, and SMAD4 (p = 0.08) in the TGF-Beta pathway. Survival analysis revealed no significant differences among H/L patients. However, NHW patients with TP53 and PI3K pathway alterations exhibited significant differences in overall survival, while those without TGF-Beta pathway alterations also showed a significant survival impact. In contrast, WNT pathway alterations were not associated with significant survival differences. These findings suggest that TP53, PI3K, and TGF-Beta pathway disruptions may have distinct prognostic implications in NHW GC patients. This study provides one of the first ethnicity-focused analyses of TP53, WNT, PI3K, TGF-Beta and RTK/RAS pathway alterations in GC, revealing significant racial/ethnic differences in pathway dysregulation. The findings suggest that TP53 and WNT alterations may play a critical role in GC among H/L patients, while PI3K and TGF-Beta alterations may have greater prognostic significance in NHW patients. These insights emphasize the need for precision medicine approaches that account for genetic heterogeneity and ethnicity-specific pathway alterations to improve cancer care and outcomes for underrepresented populations.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025
41030928,Pathway-specific genomic alterations in pancreatic cancer across diverse cohorts.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive malignancy with rising incidence and poor survival rates. While Hispanic/Latino (H/L) patients have a lower overall incidence compared to Non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients, they are diagnosed at younger ages, often present with more advanced disease, and experience worse survival outcomes. The molecular drivers underlying these disparities remain poorly understood. Key oncogenic pathways, including TP53, WNT, PI3K, TGF-Beta, and RTK/RAS, play crucial roles in tumor progression, therapy resistance, and response to targeted treatments. However, their ethnicity-specific alterations and prognostic implications in PC remain largely unexplored. This study aims to characterize pathway-specific mutations in PC among H/L and NHW patients, assess tumor mutation burden, and identify ethnicity-specific oncogenic drivers using publicly available datasets. The findings may provide critical insights to optimize precision medicine strategies and enhance targeted therapies for underrepresented populations. A bioinformatics analysis was performed using publicly available PC datasets to evaluate mutation frequencies in genes associated with the TGF-Beta, RTK/RAS, WNT, PI3K, and TP53 pathways. The study included 4,248 patients, with 407 identified as H/L and 3,841 as NHW. Patients were stratified by ethnicity to assess differences in mutation prevalence. Chi-squared tests were conducted to compare mutation rates between groups, while Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to evaluate overall survival differences based on pathway-specific alterations. Significant differences were observed in the TGF-Beta pathway between H/L and NHW patients. TGF-Beta mutations were less prevalent in H/L patients (18.4% vs. 24.4%, p = 8.6e-3). Additionally, genes related to the TGF-Beta pathway showed significant alterations, with SMAD2 (1.5% vs. 0.4%, p = 6.3e-3) and SMAD4 (15% vs. 19.9%, p = 0.02) exhibiting notable differences. Although RTK/RAS, WNT, PI3K, and TP53 pathway mutations were not statistically significant overall, borderline significance was observed in genes associated with these pathways, including ERBB4 (3.4% vs. 1.8%, p = 0.03), ALK (2.7% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.01), HRAS (1.2% vs. 0.1%, p = 1.3e-4), and RIT1 (0.7% vs. 0.1%, p = 0.03) in the RTK/RAS pathway, as well as CTNNB1 (2.9% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.01) in the WNT pathway. Survival analysis revealed no significant differences in overall survival among H/L patients.

41030927,Comparative genomic analysis of key oncogenic pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma among diverse populations.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with significant racial and ethnic disparities in incidence, tumor biology, and clinical outcomes. Hispanic/Latino (H/L) patients tend to be diagnosed at younger ages and more advanced stages than Non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying these disparities remain poorly understood. Key oncogenic pathways, including RTK/RAS, TGF-Beta, WNT, PI3K, and TP53, play pivotal roles in tumor progression, treatment resistance, and response to targeted therapies. However, ethnicity-specific alterations within these pathways remain largely unexplored. This study aims to compare pathway-specific mutations in HCC between H/L and NHW patients, assess tumor mutation burden, and identify ethnicity-associated oncogenic drivers using publicly available datasets. Findings from this analysis may inform precision medicine strategies for improving early detection and targeted therapies in underrepresented populations. We conducted a bioinformatics analysis using publicly available HCC datasets to assess mutation frequencies in RTK/RAS, TGF-Beta, WNT, PI3K, and TP53 pathway genes. The study included 547 patients, consisting of 69 H/L patients and 478 NHW patients. Patients were stratified by ethnicity (H/L vs. NHW) to evaluate differences in mutation prevalence. Chi-squared tests were used to compare mutation frequencies, while Kaplan-Meier survival analysis assessed overall survival differences associated with pathway-specific alterations in both populations. Significant differences were observed in the RTK/RAS pathway related genes, particularly in FGFR4 mutations, which were more prevalent in H/L patients compared to NHW patients (4.3% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.02). Additionally, IGF1R mutations exhibited borderline significance (7.2% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.07). In the PI3K pathway, INPP4B alterations were more frequent in H/L patients than in NHW patients (4.3% vs. 1%, p = 0.06), while in the TGF-Beta pathway, TGFBR2 mutations were more common in H/L patients (2.9% vs. 0.4%, p = 0.07), suggesting potential ethnicity-specific variations.Survival analysis revealed no significant differences in overall survival between H/L and NHW patients, indicating that molecular alterations alone may not fully explain survival disparities and suggesting a role for additional factors such as immune response, environmental exposures, or access to targeted therapies. This study provides one of the first ethnicity-focused analyses of key oncogenic pathway alterations in HCC, revealing distinct molecular differences between H/L and NHW patients. The findings suggest that RTK/RAS (FGFR4, IGF1R), PI3K (INPP4B), and TGF-Beta (TGFBR2) pathway alterations may play a distinct role in HCC among H/L patients, while their prognostic significance in NHW patients remains unclear. These insights emphasize the importance of incorporating ethnicity-specific molecular profiling into precision medicine approaches to improve early detection, targeted therapies, and clinical outcomes in HCC, particularly for underrepresented populations.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025
41030782,Illuminating the therapeutic potential of Schisandrin a against rheumatoid arthritis by targeting ferroptosis: An integrated bioinformatics and experimental study.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation and hyperplasia of the synovial membrane. This study aimed to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of Schisandrin A (SCHA), a bioactive component from Schisandra chinensis, on RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs). Integrated bioinformatics analysis was performed on transcriptomic datasets from RA and normal FLSs as well as SCHA-treated RA FLSs. Enrichment analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes between groups were significantly enriched in the ferroptosis pathway, suggesting SCHA may exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting ferroptosis. Protein-protein interaction network analysis identified Txnrd1, lpcat3 and slc7a11 as key hub genes with pivotal roles in mediating SCHA's effects, and molecular docking and dynamics simulations demonstrated that SCHA directly binds to these proteins with favorable binding affinities through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, with stable complex formation confirmed over 100-ns molecular dynamics trajectories. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflamed RA FLSs, SCHA significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β at both protein and mRNA levels, restored antioxidant enzymes GSH-Px and SOD levels, and reduced lipid peroxidation product MDA, Fe2+ and ROS levels in a dose-dependent manner Transmission electron microscopy confirmed SCHA's dose-dependent protective effects against ferroptosis-induced mitochondrial damage. Our study demonstrates inhibition of ferroptosis via targeting TXNRD1, LPCAT3 and SLC7A11 mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of SCHA on RA FLSs. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for SCHA's therapeutic potential against RA by modulating ferroptosis.",Biochemistry and biophysics reports,2025
41030776,"Investigating the Mechanism of Jiawei Weijin Decoction in Treating Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Using Network Pharmacology, Bioinformatics Analysis and Experimental Validation.","Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While Qianjin Weijin Decoction is widely used in China for lung cancer treatment, Jiawei Qianjin Weijin Decoction (JWWJD), a modified version, has shown enhanced anti-metastatic effects. However, its active components and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The effect of JWWJD against NSCLC was evaluated in vitro and in vivo, and the mechanisms were identified in combination with transcriptomics. Network pharmacology and bioinformatics were used to construct an anti-NSCLC prognostic model with JWWJD. The correlation between the expression of the prognostic gene and clinicopathological features was evaluated. The main active components of JWWJD were identified by LC-MS/MS and its anticancer effect and mechanism were investigated in vitro and in vivo. JWWJD-containing serum significantly suppressed cell proliferation and migration, and induced apoptosis in NCI-A549 and NCI-H23 cells. Among different concentrations tested, 20% drug-containing serum showed the most potent inhibitory effect on NSCLC progression (all <i>P</i>-values < 0.05). In a BALB/c-nu mouse xenograft model, oral administration of high-dose JWWJD reduced tumor volume by 27.76% compared to control (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that JWWJD treatment led to significant downregulation of SPP1 (Fold Change = 0.687, FDR < 0.05), a gene highly associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. Using LC-MS/MS, curcumol was identified as the key active component in JWWJD. Molecular studies demonstrated that curcumol directly binds to SPP1 with strong affinity (KD = 4.55×10<sup>-6</sup> M), downregulates its expression, and inhibits NSCLC cell migration and invasion. In vivo experiments showed that curcumol reduced tumor volume by 24.88% (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Our study, integrating transcriptomics, bioinformatics, LC-MS/MS, and experimental validation, revealed that JWWJD alleviates NSCLC metastasis by directly targeting SPP1. JWWJD and its active compound curcumol show promise as alternative therapies for NSCLC patients.","Drug design, development and therapy",2025

This study investigates age-stratified microbiome dynamics during NCD to enable precision interventions. This study investigated 60 female Holstein calves (1, 21, and 30 days old) from a commercial dairy farm, equally divided between healthy and diarrheal groups based on standardized fecal scoring. Fecal samples were collected aseptically, flash-frozen, and processed for 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V3-V4 region) using Illumina NovaSeq. Bioinformatics analyses included DADA2 pipeline for ASV calling, SILVA 138 database for taxonomic annotation, ANCOM-BC2 for differential abundance analysis (FDR < 0.05), PICRUSt2 for functional prediction, and SparCC networks (|r| > 0.6, <i>p</i> < 0.001) with Gephi visualization. Multivariate statistics, including PERMANOVA and canonical correspondence analysis were performed in QIIME2 and R (phyloseq/vegan packages), with all analyses rarefied to 39,161 sequences/sample. The gut microbiome exhibited age-dependent succession, transitioning from Pseudomonadota dominance (47.2 ± 0.7%) at day 1 to Bacillota/Bacteroidota co-dominance (85.5 ± 8.2%) by day 30. Age explained significantly more compositional variance than diarrhea status (3.68% vs. 1.96%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Three distinct age-specific diarrheal patterns emerged: (1) Early-stage (1-day-old) showed Bacillota/Pseudomonadota imbalances (84% of differential ASVs) with reduced network complexity (total node count, total edge count, average degree and modularity); (2) Mid-lactation (21-day-old) featured <i>Kurthia</i> as both significantly enriched (log2FC = 5.32) and a network hub (degree = 14); (3) Mature microbiota (30-day-old) displayed complex multi-phylum dysbiosis involving 10 metabolic pathways. <i>Clostridia_UCG-014</i> persisted across diarrheal networks, while healthy calves showed age-progressive increases in microbial connectivity (edges: 125 to 1,104). Only 2 ASVs demonstrated consistent differential abundance across age groups, confirming the temporal specificity of diarrheal dysbiosis. NCD-associated dysbiosis progresses through distinct developmental phases, from resilient phylum-level shifts in neonates to complex network disruptions in mature microbiota. The identification of stage-specific biomarkers (e.g., day 21 <i>Kurthia</i>) opens new avenues for age-tailored probiotic therapies and early intervention strategies.",Frontiers in microbiology,2025
41030501,Discovering biomarkers for chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps: a study integrating bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation of macrophage polarization and metabolism-related genes.,"Macrophages play a critical role in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), and their functional imbalance may cause metabolic disturbances. However, the mechanisms of their role in CRSwNP remain unclear. This study aimed to identify CRSwNP biomarkers related to macrophage polarization and metabolism, and elucidate their molecular regulatory mechanisms. In this study, transcriptomic data of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) were obtained from public databases. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened via differential expression analysis. Subsequently, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify key module genes related to macrophage polarization-related genes (MP-RGs), which were then cross-referenced with metabolism-related genes to screen for candidate genes. After that, two machine learning methods-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and random forest (RF)-were applied to further screen these candidate genes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the training set and validation set were constructed, and gene expression validation was conducted to finally determine the biomarkers. Finally, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to verify the expression levels of prognostic genes. ALOX5, HMOX1, and PLA2G7 were identified as biomarkers for CRSwNP, with AUC >0.7 in both training and validation sets, showing strong diagnostic potential. A nomogram, built on these three biomarkers, exhibited superior diagnostic performance. Enrichment analysis suggested that these biomarkers might be implicated in immune pathways. Furthermore, all three biomarkers were found to be correlated with asthma. Selenium was identified as a co-target of ALOX5 and HMOX1, presenting potential therapeutic targets for CRSwNP. A total of 10 key miRNAs regulating these biomarkers were identified, and the upstream long non-coding RNAs of hsa-miR-642a-5p, including FOXC1 and NEAT1, were predicted. Additionally, the transcription factor FOXC1 was found to concurrently regulate all three biomarkers. RT-qPCR results validated that the expression levels of ALOX5, HMOX1, and PLA2G7 were significantly elevated in CRSwNP patients, corroborating the findings from bioinformatics analyses. ALOX5, HMOX1, and PLA2G7 were identified as biomarkers linked to macrophage polarization and metabolism in CRSwNP. These findings offer new insights for early prevention strategies and clinical drug development in CRSwNP.",Frontiers in bioinformatics,2025
41030476,Composition of cardiac-derived extracellular vesicles changes with vesicle origin and determines uptake.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. The potency of cell-based therapies for CVD is increasingly attributed to the release of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) which consist of a lipid/protein membrane and encapsulate nucleic cargo. Specifically, sEVs from ckit + progenitor cells (CPCs) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are shown to be pro-reparative, with clinical trials conducted. Despite copious research into sEV cargo, the role of parent cell type on sEV membrane composition and its effects on sEV uptake mechanism by recipient cells remain unclear. This is crucial for designing sEV-based therapeutics as uptake mechanism dictates the functionality of the cargo. In this study we investigate the role of sEV parent cell and membrane composition on the mechanism of EV uptake by recipient cells. We find that sEV membrane lipid and protein composition varies by parent cell type. Further, vesicle uptake mechanism varies by both sEV parent cell type and recipient cell type, with clathrin-mediated uptake being the most variable across parent cell conditions. Using a partial least squares regression model, we observe that proteins important in clathrin-mediated uptake (e.g., TPM1, MRC2, FSTL1, LTBP1) are dissimilar to other vesicle uptake mechanisms. This work underscores the importance of the sEV source and membrane composition on uptake, and in turn the importance of selecting specific sEVs based on the target recipient cells for CVD therapies.",Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2025
41030462,Identification and Validation of Hub Genes in Hidradenitis Suppurativa.,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a severe, chronic inflammatory disease characterized by inflammatory nodules, progressive sinus tracts, and fistulas. Currently, its pathogenesis remain incompletely understood, and while diverse treatments are available, these have suboptimal efficacy. Herein, we analyzed the relevant genes and pathways in HS using bioinformatics to provide directions for the development of novel treatment. Two HS datasets were obtained, and differentially expressed genes associated with HS were identified. Enrichment analysis was performed, and a protein-protein interaction network of differential genes was produced. Genes were analyzed using the CytoHubba plugin to obtain the hub genes. For validation, we analyzed the differentially expressed genes between the affected skin tissues of patients with HS and normal human skin tissues. Overall, 180 differential genes associated with HS were identified. Differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in leukocyte migration, serine hydrolase activity, and serine-type peptidase activity. In total, 69 transcription factors, 115 microRNAs, and 41 drugs associated with hub genes were identified. The expression of <i>FCGR2A</i> and <i>IL2RG</i> was significantly upregulated in the HS disease group compared with that in the normal group. Ten hub genes were identified. Among these, <i>FCGR2A</i> is responsible for the phagocytosis and clearance of immune complexes, the dysregulation of which may represent an important link in the pathogenesis of HS. The PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, regulated by the <i>IL2RG</i> gene, showed a close relationship with HS severity and the mechanism of scarring, presenting a potential drug target. The miR-3689 targeting the gene FCGR2A might also be potential biomarkers.","Clinical, cosmetic and investigational dermatology",2025
41030312,Pan-cancer analysis reveals HMOX1 as a cancer prognosis and immune infiltration-related biomarker.,"HMOX1 has gained increasing recognition across multiple malignancies; however, its precise oncogenic or tumor-suppressive roles remain incompletely defined. In this study, we comprehensively investigated HMOX1 across diverse tumor types utilizing the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). We further integrated data from multiple bioinformatics platforms, including TIMER2, UALCAN, GEPIA2, cBioPortal, R, GSCA, and LinkedOmics. Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed differential HMOX1 expression between normal renal epithelial cells and KIRC cells. Functional assays <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> demonstrated that HMOX1 regulates proliferation, migration, and cell-cycle progression in 786-O and Caki-1 cells. Pan-cancer analyses revealed that HMOX1 is aberrantly expressed across multiple malignancies with significant associations with the tumor stage. Survival analyses indicated that elevated HMOX1 expression predicted poor overall survival (OS) in LGG (<i>P</i> = 0.025) but favorable OS and disease-free survival (DFS) in KIRC (OS: <i>P</i> = 0.00062; DFS: <i>P</i> = 9 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). Moreover, mutations were the predominant genetic alteration affecting HMOX1, while promoter methylation was broadly reduced across cancers. HMOX1 expression positively correlated with immune infiltration by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (KIRC: Spearman <i>ρ</i> = 0.26, FDR = 2.56 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) and macrophages (KIRC: Spearman <i>ρ</i> = 0.32, FDR = 2.77 × 10<sup>-13</sup>). Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses in KIRC implicated HMOX1 in the chemokine and NF-κB signaling pathways. Both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments demonstrated that HMOX1 knockdown accelerates cell-cycle progression and enhances proliferation and migration in 786-O and Caki-1 cells. Collectively, our findings establish HMOX1 as a promising prognostic biomarker and potential immunotherapeutic target across multiple cancers.",RSC medicinal chemistry,2025
41030060,miR-129-5p Modulates <i>Fndc5</i> Expression in Adipose Tissue of Diabetic Mice.,"The study aims to investigate the regulatory mechanism of the <i>Fndc5</i> gene in subcutaneous adipose tissue of diabetic mice, with a focus on the role of miR-129-5p in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Specifically, it examines how the dysregulation of miR-129-5p affects <i>Fndc5</i> expression and contributes to diabetesrelated metabolic changes. By exploring these molecular pathways, the research seeks to enhance our understanding of T2DM and identify potential therapeutic targets for its complications. In this experimental study, a total of 12 C57BL/6 male mice (6 weeks old) were divided into control and 60% high-fat enriched advanced glycation end products (60% HF-AGE) groups (n=6 per group). Bioinformatics analysis involved mining altered miRNAs in type 2 diabetes and predicting miRNA interactions with <i>Fndc5</i> mRNA. RNA and proteins extracted from adipose tissue analyzed by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunoblotting, respectively. The dual luciferase reporter assay investigated direct interaction between miR-129-5p and the <i>Fndc5</i> gene using HEK293T cells transfected with relevant vectors. In mice receiving a 60% HF-AGE diet, significant increases in energy intake, body weight, insulin levels, and fasting blood glucose (FBS) were observed. Furthermore, miR-129-5p was identified as a potential regulator of the Fndc5 gene, displaying elevated expression in diabetic adipose tissue. Plasmid construction confirmed the binding site of miR-129-5p on the <i>Fndc5</i> 3'UTR, while dual luciferase assays validated its direct targeting of the Fndc5 transcript. This interaction corresponded with a reduced expression of <i>Fndc5</i>, highlighting its potential role in diabetes-related metabolic dysregulation. The upregulation of mir-129-5p in these tissues and the subsequent decrease in the expression of the <i>Fndc5</i> gene may play a role in developing pathological conditions in this tissue. These findings highlight potential mechanisms linking diet-induced diabetes with <i>Fndc5</i> regulation through miR-129-5p.",Cell journal,2025
41029807,Regulatory role of ezrin in esophageal cancer progression via the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.,"The progression of esophageal cancer (EC) has been associated with aberrant activation of oncogenes and suppression of tumor suppressor genes. The EZR gene encodes ezrin, which is highly activated and upregulated in cancer cells, contributing to their invasive potential. This study aimed to elucidate the role of ezrin in EC progression, with a specific focus on the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Expression of the EZR gene was silenced in ECA109 cells to assess changes in the phosphorylation levels of multiple kinases Bioinformatics analyses were conducted to identify ezrin-associated signaling pathways. In vitro functional assays were performed to investigate the effects of EZR silencing on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Cells with EZR knockdown demonstrated markedly decreased phosphorylation of AKT1/2/3 (S473), EGFR (Y1086), PLC-γ1 (Y783), Src (Y419), STAT5a/b (Y694/Y699), Yes (Y426), and β-Catenin, relative to control cells. These findings indicate that the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is a critical downstream mediator of ezrin activity. The inhibition of AKT phosphorylation resulting from EZR knockdown was reversed upon treatment with an AKT pathway activator, confirming the involvement of this signaling axis. Functionally, EZR silencing significantly reduced EC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and increased apoptosis. These effects were attenuated, in part, by concurrent activation of the AKT pathway. Collectively, the data suggest that ezrin modulates key oncogenic processes in EC through the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Ezrin contributes to the progression of EC through modulation of the PI3K-AKT signaling cascade, influencing cellular proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion.",Hereditas,2025

Understanding its molecular mechanisms is crucial for developing effective treatments. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA)-liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and GSE101685 data sets were analyzed using the ""limma"" tool in R. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified the key turquoise module. Bioinformatics analyzed the prognostic significance and expression of CCDC137. Functional analyses assessed the effects of CCDC137 on cell behavior and tumor growth. The connection between CCDC137 and DGCR8 and their impact on the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and glycolysis were also examined. A total of 670 overlapping DEGs were identified, and CCDC137, located within the turquoise module, was found to be significantly associated with HCC. CCDC137 was upregulated in HCC, correlating with worse prognostic outcomes. Experimental validation demonstrated that CCDC137 knockdown significantly reduced HCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth. Mechanistically, CCDC137 may promote aerobic glycolysis through modulation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, potentially mediated via its interaction with DGCR8. These findings suggest that the CCDC137/DGCR8 axis may contribute to HCC progression by regulating cellular metabolism through the AKT/mTOR pathway. Targeting this regulatory network may offer a promising direction for future therapeutic exploration in HCC.",European journal of medical research,2025
41029534,Identification of aberrantly expressed circular RNAs in choroidal neovascularization in mice.,"To show the representation profile and potential functions of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in a mouse model of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). In one CNV mouse model, circRNA expression profiles were determined through microarray analysis. Selected altered circRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR. In addition to a KEGG analysis, gene ontology (GO) enrichment was implemented to measure signaling pathways, as well as biological functions. CircRNA/miRNA interactions were forecast using TargetScan and miRana programs. Choroidal flatmounts and qRT-PCR were then implemented in an attempt to examine the function of circRNA_0000273 in macrophage polarization and CNV formation. This study found that 134 circRNAs were differentially expressed within the CNV mouse model (<i>P</i>< 0.05, fold change > 1.5). Their host genes were found to be involved in cellular component organization (ontology: biologic reaction), organelles (ontology: cell component), and protein binding (ontology: molecular function). The mRNAs expressed with circRNAs were largely engaged in the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. CircRNA_0000273 was significantly increased in M2 macrophages. Moreover, the inhibition of circRNA_0000273 was found to suppress M2 macrophage gene expression and CNV formation in the laser-induced mouse model. CircRNAs are involved in CNV pathogenesis, and circRNA_0000273 is an underlying target for CNV prevention and therapy.",BMC ophthalmology,2025
41029392,SET8 modulates prognosis and radiotherapeutic efficacy by regulating radiation-induced migration in lung adenocarcinoma.,"Tumor migration in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) contributes to a poor prognosis by allowing malignant cells to escape the localized effects of radiotherapy, diminishing its overall efficacy. This study investigated the role of SET8, a methyltransferase, in LUAD migration and radiotherapy. In vitro experiments, including CRISPR/Cas9-mediated SET8 knockout, wound healing assays, and transwell migration assays, were used to assess the impact of SET8 on radiation-induced migration in LUAD cells. Bioinformatics analyses, such as differential expression analysis, clustering, functional enrichment, and CpG island methylation analysis, were performed using LUAD patient data from TCGA to examine the broader relationship between SET8, LUAD migration, and prognosis. Statistical methods, including Cox regression and LASSO regression, were employed to establish a prognostic model for radiotherapy outcomes, and drug sensitivity analysis was used to identify potential therapeutic agents. Ionizing radiation induced migration in LUAD cells, coupled with altered SET8 expression. SET8 was found to engage in IR-induced migration through the PTTG1-PI3K-AKT signaling axis. Furthermore, elevated SET8 expression was more prevalent in LUAD patients with metastasis and correlated with adverse prognosis. Under equivalent X-ray irradiation doses, SET8 depletion significantly inhibited the migratory capability of LUAD cells. Finally, SET8-associated migration genes could predict the survival rate, radiation responsiveness, and drug sensitivity of radiotherapy patients. SET8 facilitates radiation-induced migration in LUAD through the PTTG1-PI3K-AKT pathway, and SET8-associated genes may act as valuable markers for predicting radiotherapeutic efficacy in LUAD patients.",Journal of translational medicine,2025

Current treatments are often ineffective, underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of OA's molecular mechanisms. We investigate cell death mechanisms like pyroptosis and autophagy in OA, using gene expression omnibus datasets to identify differentially expressed genes and develop a protein-protein interaction network highlighting 7 critical genes, including gap junction alpha-1 protein (GJA1) as a potential biomarker. We also created a diagnostic model validated through receiver operating characteristic analysis, which could enhance OA detection and improve patient outcomes. Experimental results from quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed the downregulation of GJA1 in the OA group. Significant downregulation of GJA1 expression in patients diagnosed with OA was confirmed. GJA1 may function as a novel regulatory factor in the onset and progression of OA, with potential applications as a diagnostic biomarker for the condition.",Medicine,2025
41029063,Comprehensive investigation of a new signature integrating lipid metabolism and immune-related genes for clear cell renal cell carcinoma prognosis and immunometabolism landscapes.,"Multi-omics studies have significantly advanced our understanding of ccRCC. These studies have revealed that aggressive ccRCC is closely associated with metabolic reprogramming, particularly involving lipid metabolism. Recent studies have highlighted the crosstalk between lipid metabolism and immune function in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of ccRCC. However, prognostic models integrating both pathways remain underdeveloped. A detailed analysis was conducted on the varied lipid metabolism subtypes utilizing 638 records of clear cell renal cell carcinoma from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, focusing on lipid metabolism genes and immune-related genes (LRGs). The clinical importance, functional status, TME interaction, and genetic alterations of various subtypes were further investigated. A novel grading system, the lipid-immune score (LIS), was created and validated. Two distinct subgroups, characterized by elevated expression of lipid metabolism genes and exhibiting traits of tumor metabolism and proliferation, are classified as lipid metabolism phenotypes. The lipid metabolism phenotype exhibits a more favorable prognosis, enhanced anti-tumor immunity, and increased sensitivity to immunotherapy. The expression of more LRGs, the enrichment of immunoreactive pathways, and the infiltration of effector immune cells are characterized as immunoreactive phenotypes. The prognosis for the immunoactive phenotype is unfavorable and is more prevalent in patients experiencing tumor progression. Furthermore, BAP1 is a pivotal mutant gene in the immunoactive subtype. LIS was ultimately shown as a reliable predictor of overall survival (OS) and immunotherapy outcomes in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. We systematically analyzed immune- and lipid metabolism-related genes, identifying 2 distinct molecular subtypes with differing biological functions, immune profiles, and clinical outcomes. We also developed a LIS that effectively predicts patient prognosis and immunotherapy response, offering a new strategy for precision medicine in ccRCC. Our research elucidates the relationship between lipid metabolism and immune response, offering a distinctive strategy for therapeutic management and precision medicine in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.",Medicine,2025
41029021,Comprehensive Pan-cancer analysis of Pyroglutamylated RFamide Peptide Receptor: Its Potential Biological Functions and Associations with Prognosis and Immunity.,"The receptor for pyroglutamylated RF amide peptide (QRFPR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a role in various physiological and pathological processes. However, a gap remains in our understanding of QRFPR's pan-cancer properties. This study performs an extensive pan-cancer analysis of QRFPR utilizing large-scale genomic datasets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We evaluated QRFPR expression levels in multiple malignancies and examined their correlations with clinical outcomes. Additionally, we investigated associations between QRFPR expression and immune cell infiltration using bioinformatics tools. Our results reveal significant alterations in QRFPR expression across several cancer types, particularly breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers. Elevated levels of QRFPR are linked to poor prognosis in certain malignancies, such as uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) and mesothelioma (MESO), and correlate with increased infiltration of immune cells, especially T cells and macrophages. Pathway enrichment analyses suggest that QRFPR may impact critical signaling pathways associated with cell growth, apoptosis, and immune regulation. The observed variations in QRFPR expression across cancer types suggest its diverse roles in tumor biology. Its association with unfavorable clinical outcomes in specific cancers, as well as its link to immune cell infiltration, highlights its multifaceted impact on tumor progression and microenvironment modulation. Our findings underscore the potential of QRFPR as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer biology. Further investigations into its functional mechanisms could pave the way for precision medicine approaches in oncology.",Current medicinal chemistry,2025
41028964,Full-length isoform constructor (FLIC) - a tool for isoform discovery based on long reads.,"Advances in high-throughput sequencing have illuminated the complexity of transcriptome landscape in eukaryotes. An inherent part of this complexity is the presence of multiple isoforms generated by the alternative splicing and the use of alternative transcription start and polyadenylation sites. However, currently available tools have limited capacity to infer full-length isoforms. We developed a new pipeline, FLIC (Full-Length Isoform Constructor). FLIC is based on the long-read transcriptome data and integrates several key features: 1) utilizing biological replicate concordance to filter out noise and artifacts; 2) employing peak calling to precisely identify transcription start and polyadenylation sites; 3) enabling robust isoform reconstruction with minimal reliance on existing annotations. We evaluated FLIC using a dedicated set of real and simulated data of Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA sequencing. Results demonstrate that FLIC accurately reconstructs known and novel isoforms, outperforming existing tools, especially in the absence of reference annotations. A direct comparison with CAGE, currently regarded as the gold standard for transcription start site identification, shows that FLIC is equally accurate, while being much less time-consuming. Thus, FLIC provides a valuable tool for comprehensive transcript characterization, particularly for non-model organisms or when dealing with incomplete or inaccurate annotations. FLIC is available at https://github.com/albidgy/FLIC. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",2025
41028963,Self-supervised Representation Learning on Gene Expression Data.,"Predicting phenotypes from gene expression data is a crucial task in biomedical research, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses, and personalized medicine. Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely on supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that are costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data. Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to overcome these limitations by extracting information directly from the structure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data for phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on different approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure of the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for downstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene expression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively capture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The results obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform traditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by reducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also provide recommendations for using these methods depending on the case under study. Finally, we outline future research directions to enhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene expression data analysis. This study is the first work that deals with bulk RNA-Seq data and self-supervised learning. The code and results are available at https://github.com/kdradjat/ssrl-rnaseq.

41028903,C1QBP forms a positive feedback loop with the PAICS/FAK/C-MYC axis to promote cancer cell proliferation.,"The cell membrane, as the boundary of the cellular system, plays an extremely important role in the regulation of cellular metabolism, substance transport, information exchange and cellular immunity. Complement component 1q subcomponent binding protein (C1QBP) is a ubiquitously expressed cellular protein, and although multiple studies have suggested that C1QBP may play an important role in cancer, the functions and mechanisms of C1QBP in the progression of many tumors remain unknown. We performed bioinformatics analysis and found that C1QBP was significantly overexpressed in a variety of tumor tissues and that high C1QBP expression correlates strongly with poor prognosis in tumor patients. Further validation in cholangiocarcinoma(CCA) revealed that C1QBP is the most upregulated membrane protein in CCA, where it is involved in energy metabolism, DNA repair, and tolerance to platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents. It also correlates strongly with CCA proliferation and poor prognosis, while silencing of C1QBP significantly inhibits CCA growth in mice. Mechanistic studies further demonstrated that c-MYC can upregulate C1QBP expression at the transcriptional level, subsequently influencing PAICS/FAK expression and promoting CCA growth. Interestingly, C1QBP also regulates c-MYC expression by increasing FAK phosphorylation, establishing a positive feedback loop that drives tumor progression. Additionally, we developed a novel siRNA delivery system, HA gel-siC1QBP, by encapsulating siC1QBP within hyaluronic acid-dopamine hydrogel-coated liposomes. In vivo experiments confirmed its ability to provide prolonged and stable C1QBP inhibition along with enhanced antitumor efficacy. In conclusion, our study suggests that C1QBP may serve as a valuable biomarker for tumour prognosis and that silencing C1QBP using HA gel-siC1QBP -either alone or combined with targeted/ immunotherapies -represents a promising therapeutic strategy against tumors.",Oncogene,2025
41028890,Construction and evaluation of a prognostic model for breast cancer based on aging related genes.,"Aging plays an important role in the development of breast cancer (BRCA); however, the specific underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, consensus clustering was initially used to classify BRCA subtypes. Thereafter, differentially expressed genes were identified within BRCA datasets and across subtypes, with overlapping genes being selected for further analysis. Cox regression analysis was used to identify key genes to construct a risk model for predicting prognosis. Furthermore, GSVA was used for pathway enrichment analysis, the infiltration levels of various immune cells were assessed, and the correlation between immune checkpoints and risk scores was analyzed. Finally, the expression levels of the key genes were validated through qRT-PCR. In addition, we also investigated the role of CXCL14 overexpression in the proliferation, invasion, and migration of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells at a cell density ratio of 2:1, and the proportion of live CD8+ T cells was measured by flow cytometry. Cox analysis revealed JCHAIN, KRT15, and CXCL14 as key prognosis-related genes; therefore, these genes were used to construct the risk model. In addition, age and stage were identified as independent prognostic factors. GSVA showed pathway enrichment in various risk groups, with the infiltration levels of 27 immune cell types being correlated with the risk score. The high-risk group exhibited downregulation of LAG3, CD274, CTLA4, and PDCD1. qRT-PCR validated the downregulation of JCHAIN and CXCL14 in a specific subgroup. CXCL14 overexpression significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration capabilities of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, CXCL14 further suppressed tumor occurrence and development by activating CD8+ T cell-mediated immune mechanisms. In this study, the aging-related genes JCHAIN, KRT15, and CXCL14 were identified as key biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of BRCA.",Scientific reports,2025
41028863,Enhancing CYP2D6 genotyping with nanopore sequencing to address allele diversity P. vivax malaria elimination.,"The precise profiling of CYP2D6 alleles is critical for identifying patients who are likely to benefit from primaquine therapy, a standard treatment for preventing P. vivax relapse and, as a result, obstacle for malaria elimination. Conventional assays often fall short, as they do not capture the wide range of allele diversity found at the CYP2D6 locus, particularly in populations from malaria-endemic regions. In response, we developed a methodology integrating cost-effective DNA library preparation with nanopore sequencing, reducing reliance on extensive third-party enzymes and reagents and shortening processing times to enhance accessibility. Using well-characterized DNA standards, we evaluated various bioinformatics tools for their ability to accurately call CYP2D6 star alleles. Nanopore sequencing proved particularly valuable for identifying complex structural variants, which led us to propose a novel approach to manage hybrid structural variations using long-read amplicon data. We conducted an in-depth genotypic analysis of DNA samples from 90 individuals in Thailand's Greater Mekong Subregion, achieving a high level of resolution in CYP2D6 genotyping. This analysis not only identified structural variants but also a previously unidentified allele. The findings suggest potential paths forward for testing that is sensitive to local genetic variability and supports informed policy decision-making in real time, thereby potentially enhancing the effectiveness of P. vivax elimination.",Scientific reports,2025

41028705,Detection of Ethylene Signaling Using Bioinformatics Tools in Plants.,"Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is vital in plant growth, development, biotic or abiotic stresses, fruit ripening, and senescence. The ethylene signaling machinery includes several genes, many of which are multigene family members and exhibit spatial and temporal expression patterns. These genes also show divergence and expansion during evolution. Recent high-throughput technologies have promoted a more comprehensive profiling of genes regulated by ethylene signaling. The availability of a large amount of sequencing data from whole genome, transcriptome, small RNA, etc., in the public databases provides an informative resource for gene mining of ethylene. However, these omics data generally result in large gene lists that make it challenging to interpret the data and extract insights into biological significance. Different platforms have different architectures and designs, and even similar studies using the same platform may obtain data with significant variances because of the highly dynamic and flexible effects of plant hormones, making comparisons across different studies and platforms difficult. Hence, the method of analysis suggests the requirement of database for their respective analysis. Some of the databases reported to find the genomics, transcriptomics, and regulatory mechanism of ethylene are The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR), Banana Genome Hub (BGH), Citrus genome database (CGD), OneKP database, miRDeep-2, miRDP, psRNATarget, Arabidopsis Hormone Database (AHD), and gene set-level analyses of hormone responses (GSHR). The present chapter deals with the online and offline methods and basic workflow for the detection of ethylene signaling machinery.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025
41028529,Bioinformatics and machine learning reveal novel prognostic biomarkers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the seventh most common cancer worldwide, has become more closely linked to poor lifestyle habits. Despite improvements in cancer treatment approaches, patients with stage I-II HNSCC have a 70-90% 5-year survival rate, and for patients with advanced stages III-IV, this rate falls to about 40%. This controversy is all about the heterogeneity of HNSCC. Finding diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers has the potential to make significant improvements in the life expectancy and overall health of these patients. The combination of bioinformatics and machine learning has facilitated the finding of the best markers for HNSCC. In this regard, RNA expression data were obtained to identify genes that were expressed differently (DEGs) and utilize a deep learning algorithm to identify genes that exhibited significant variability. In addition, correlations between clinical data and DEGs, the building of a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and the prediction of tumor-infiltrating immune cells were analyzed. Deep learning analysis identified diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers strongly associated with carcinogenesis, such as KRT33B, KRTAP3-3, C14orf34, and ACADM. In addition, after analyzing the ROC curve, it was found that the combination of ACADM, KRT33B, and C14orf34 is the most practical combination of diagnostic markers. This combination achieved sensitivity, specificity, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of 0.92, 0.86, and 0.93, respectively.",Journal of applied genetics,2025

41028385,Flow Cytometry and K-mer-Based Approach for Genome Size Estimation of Clusterbean: A Case Study.,"With the increasing focus on whole-genome sequencing and genomic studies in non-model organisms, there is a growing demand for reliable and accessible methods to estimate eukaryotic genome sizes across diverse taxa. Accurate genome size determination is essential for advancing genomic research and breeding programs, particularly in plants. Here, we have provided the details of two methodologies used for estimating genome size in clusterbean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) flow cytometry [estimated genome size 580.9 Mb ± 0.02 (1C)] and the K-mer based approach (estimated genome 543.2 Mb). Flow cytometry involves staining clusterbean nuclei with a DNA-binding dye and measuring fluorescence intensity using a flow cytometer and provides a rapid genome size estimate by comparing the fluorescence data of unknown samples to a standard reference species with a known genome size. In contrast, the K-mer-based approach employs high-throughput sequencing data to analyze K-mer frequencies in short DNA sequences of length K, enabling genome size estimation through computational models. While this method is highly precise and does not require a reference genome, it necessitates extensive sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Our study found that flow cytometry offered a quick estimation with some variability, whereas the K-mer based approach yielded a more accurate and detailed genome size estimate, and the fraction of heterozygosity in clusterbean genome was estimated to be in the range of 0.70-0.71%. This comparative analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of each method, assisting researchers in choosing the most suitable technique based on their specific needs and available resources.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2026
41028381,Applications of the Soybean Expression Atlas in Genomics and Transcriptomics Research.,"Genomics, the study of an organism's full set of genes, is often enhanced by gene expression data from RNA analysis, reflecting the correlation between gene function and expression profiles. This is particularly important for understanding complex traits regulated by multiple genes. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become a standard technique for studying gene expression, especially in crops like soybean (Glycine max), which is valued for its high protein and oil content. Despite the availability of soybean genomic data, processing raw RNA-Seq data into usable formats remains a resource-intensive task, often requiring expensive hardware and bioinformatics expertise. The Soybean Expression Atlas (SEA) simplifies this process by providing access to transcript- and gene-level abundance data from 5481 RNA-Seq samples through a user-friendly interface. SEA's features include tools like the Global Expression Viewer for visualizing gene expression profiles and the Search Gene List for generating lists across selected tissues. Users can also download gene expression matrices by BioProject and explore gene metadata, including tissue-specific indices and protein domain filters. SEA has facilitated studies of key metabolic pathways in soybean, such as oil biosynthesis, nodulation, and responses to environmental factors. It has also supported the development of additional tools in G. max and inspired similar initiatives in other plant species. This chapter demonstrates SEA's application in pathogen research, using examples of the fungal species Colletotrichum truncatum and the soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines, showcasing SEA's utility for narrowing down genes of interest for specific traits.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2026

41028371,Local Haplotyping Analysis for Flowering Time in Soybean Using Crosshap.,"The vast amount of genomic data available for various plant species has enabled a greater understanding of genomic regions associated with phenotypic variation, mainly through approaches such as Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). However, relying solely on GWAS results limits our understanding of trait variation, as it focuses on individual SNPs without considering the linked variants that may also influence the trait. As a follow-up to GWAS, haplotype analysis focusing on local regions of the genome can provide detailed insights into the genetic variants associated with a trait. crosshap, a local haplotyping R-package, identifies and visualises haplotype structures, allowing users to explore allelic diversity and associated phenotypic variation in targeted genomic regions. This chapter demonstrates local haplotyping analysis using crosshap to understand the genetic control of flowering time in domesticated and wild soybean, informing breeding strategies and crop improvement efforts; however, crosshap can be applied to any species where suitable data is available.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2026

However, current antibody-based antivenoms exert limited neutralisation effects against CTX-induced dermonecrosis. This study focused on discovering aptamer-based antivenom that specifically targets CTX, using repetitive centrifugation-based Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) selection approach and Illumina amplicon next-generation sequencing. A total of 12 repetitive centrifugation-based selection rounds including a negative selection between rounds 7 and 8 were performed. This was followed by amplicon next-generation sequencing and sequencing bioinformatics workflow to analyse the abundance and persistence of the CTX-binding candidates. Sequences with log<sub>10</sub> read counts of 2-3 with a round representation of 3-4 were selected as the final candidates. A linear and single-stranded DNA, 40T, was discovered and it exhibited high binding affinity and specificity to CTX with dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 0.33-0.41 µM, as demonstrated by direct and competitive enzyme-linked aptamer assay (ELAA). 40T acquired a 'sandwich' configuration binding to CTX at the functional epitopes. It exhibited neutralisation potency against the CTX-induced cytotoxicity with EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.47 µM. To mimic the real envenomation situation, venoms from Naja sputatrix, Naja siamensis, and Naja sumatrana were used to induce experimentally envenomed model for treatment with 40T. 40T demonstrated notable cell viability-restoring effects against these venoms at low micromolar ratios.

This study systematically investigated the key genes and molecular mechanisms of bone nonunion after finger replantation induced by high glucose using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), bioinformatics, and experimental analyses. In total, 179 differentially expressed mRNAs and one lncRNA (DElncRNA) were identified using the GEO dataset. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these genes were mainly involved in the regulation of autophagy and metabolism. Protein-protein interaction network analysis identified five core genes (Peroxiredoxin 2 [PRDX2], FK506 binding protein 8 [FKBP8], SHANK-associated RH domain interactor [SHARPIN], WD repeat domain 45 [WDR45], and gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor-associated protein like 2 [GABARAPL2]), three of which exhibited good binding affinities for potential therapeutic agents. Immune infiltration analysis revealed significant differences in the CD8+ T cell proportions between nonunion and healthy samples. We constructed a competitive endogenous RNA network (long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 687 [LINC00687]-miR-4443-PRDX2) and verified its direct regulatory interaction using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. FKBP8, PRDX2, SHARPIN, WDR45, and GABARAPL2 were overexpressed in tissue samples from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus fracture nonunion. Animal experiments further confirmed that LINC00687 upregulated PRDX2 expression by sponging miR-4443 in a hyperglycemic environment, thereby inhibiting bone healing. This study not only identified PRDX2 and other genes as potential biomarkers of diabetic nonunion but also clarified the regulatory role of the LINC00687/miR-4443/PRDX2 axis in hyperglycemia-induced nonunion, providing a new molecular target for clinical prevention and treatment.

Postbiotic compounds have gained significant interest, with microbial exopolysaccharides standing out due to their complex structures, diverse functions, and ability to provide benefits without requiring live microbial cells. High-molecular-weight polysaccharides, known as exopolysaccharides, are produced and secreted by a wide range of microorganisms, particularly lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria. Their roles reach beyond providing structural support; they also influence biofilm formation, modulate the host's immune response, exhibit antioxidant activity, and contribute to antimicrobial defense. This review offers a comprehensive examination of the microbial origins, classification, biosynthetic pathways, and physical and chemical properties of exopolysaccharides. It emphasizes recent advances in extraction, purification, and structural analysis methods, including both traditional and modern techniques. The functional properties of exopolysaccharides, such as immunomodulatory, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor effects, are explored in detail along with their underlying mechanisms. The review highlights applications of exopolysaccharides in food technology, pharmaceuticals, and biomedical engineering, demonstrating their versatility as postbiotic biomolecules. Although exopolysaccharides show promising bioactivities, challenges remain in scaling up production and achieving standardization due to strain-specific variability, low yields, and regulatory hurdles. While most existing studies rely on conventional biochemical and structural analyses, the emerging multi-omics, bioinformatics, and AI-driven approaches are discussed to provide predictive and mechanistic insights into EPS structure, function relationships.

41027350,Global epidemiology and genomic perspectives on vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium: Rising antimicrobial resistance and transmission risks within the one health framework.,"Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) can be detected in the intestines of humans and animals, as well as in various environments. As multidrug resistant bacteria, E. faecium causes infections that are difficult to treat and pose a significant threat to public health. In this study, we analyzed 1632 vanA or vanB-positive isolates from Homo sapiens, animals, natural environments, and hospital environments across 49 countries. MLST analysis revealed a total of 127 different sequence types, with notably higher sequence type (ST) diversity observed in the United States. ST117 and ST80 were the most common VREfm sequence types and should be continuously monitored in future surveillance programs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a potential risk of clonal transmission in VREfm. Furthermore, genomic clustering via split k-mer and core genome SNP analyses identified cross-species, cross-border, and nosocomial transmission clusters, confirming multidirectional spread. Bioinformatics analyses revealed 68 antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) subtypes, predominantly conferring resistance to glycopeptides, aminoglycosides, and multiple classes of antibiotics. Temporal analysis revealed a 42 % increase in the average number of ARGs per isolate over three decades, along with the emergence of novel resistance genes, indicating a persistent increase in antimicrobial resistance. Geographical and source-based differences were observed in the number of antibiotic resistance gene subtypes. Specifically, H. sapiens isolates carried significantly more ARGs than did their animal or environmental counterparts (p < 0.001), whereas isolates from low-income countries presented a greater ARG burden than did those from high-income regions (p < 0.05). Mobile genetic elements, particularly plasmids, were strongly correlated with the number of ARGs (p < 0.001), as validated through explainable artificial intelligence. In conclusion, this study emphasizes the importance of monitoring and exploring the evolution of VREfm strains, particularly changes in antibiotic resistance genes and the spread of these strains, within the ""One Health"" framework. Moreover, heightened vigilance in epidemiological surveillance and infection control practices is necessary.",The Science of the total environment,2025

It has emerged as a significant global public health challenge and is the leading risk factor for mortality. Barbatic acid has a pharmacological basis for preventing and treating hypertension, including mechanisms such as diuresis and anti-inflammatory effects. However, its therapeutic potential and mechanism of action remain incompletely understood. The purpose of this study is to investigate the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of barbatic acid in the treatment of hypertension. Based on the biolabel-led research model, bioinformatics was employed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the therapeutic potential, advantages, and mechanisms of action of barbatic acid in treating hypertension. Ang II was utilized to establish a hypertensive cellular model, while L-NAME was employed to create an animal model of hypertension, thereby validating the findings from the biolabel analysis. Bioinformatics indicates that ten biolabels are implicated in the anti-hypertensive mechanism of barbatic acid. The primary targets are HIF1A and FLT1, which primarily contribute to inflammatory responses and endothelial dysfunction. Cell experiments demonstrate that barbatic acid can effectively enhance the proliferation ability of HUVECs and adjust the levels of ten biolabels and downstream targets. Animal experiments demonstrate that barbatic acid can effectively reduce blood pressure in hypertensive mice, significantly ameliorate associated pathological damage in the heart, kidney, and thoracic aorta tissues, and inhibit HIF1A/FLT1 levels in these mice, thereby improving the inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction. The verification confirmed the analytical results of the biolabel research model. Barbatic acid has the capacity to inhibit the inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction in hypertension by mediating the HIF1A/FLT1 pathway.",Computers in biology and medicine,2025
41027243,Integrative computational and experimental validation of Piperlongumine as a therapeutic agent targeting differentially expressed genes in colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major global health concern due to its high incidence and mortality. Recent studies have shown the potential of phytocompounds in CRC therapeutics. This study explores the anticancer potential of Piperlongumine (PIP), a natural phytocompound, in CRC through an integrative bioinformatics and experimental approach. Initially, integrative computational databases of GEO, CTD and GeneCards resulted in 11 common differentially expressed genes potentially targeted by PIP in CRC, showing involvement in multiple signaling pathways and apoptotic signaling. Further, protein-protein interaction analysis identified five hub genes- TP53, CCND1, AKT1, CTNNB1 and IL1B, showing significant expression alterations and correlations with poor prognosis and metastasis in CRC. The molecular docking demonstrated strong binding affinity between PIP and hub genes, alongside favorable pharmacokinetics including high gastro-intestinal absorption and minimal toxicity. Experimental validations on CRC cell lines- SW-480 and HT-29 revealed dose-dependent cytotoxicity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3 μM and 4 μM, respectively. In addition, in vitro assays confirmed PIP's cytotoxic, anti-migratory, pro-apoptotic effects, and modulation of hub genes (TP53↑; CCND1, AKT1, CTNNB1, IL1B↓), supporting its mechanistic role in CRC. Together, these findings support that PIP exerts anticancer effects through modulation of hub genes, thus making it a potential therapeutic agent against CRC. This study is relevant as it bridges computational predictions with experimental validation, providing a systematic framework for natural compound evaluation in CRC. Unlike previous reports, this study uniquely combines multi-dataset transcriptomics, hub-gene prioritization, and ADMET profiling with in-vitro gene-level validation, which has not been previously reported for PIP in CRC.","Pathology, research and practice",2025
41027195,Investigating the association between bisphenols and diabetes: Evidence from epidemiological and bioinformatics.,"Bisphenol A (BPA), widely employed in the manufacture of plastics, has been associated with the development of numerous diseases. Bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS) have been introduced as common substitutes for BPA; however, their safety profiles remain contentious, particularly regarding potential associations with diabetes risk. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between exposure to bisphenols (BPs) and the prevalence of diabetes among U.S. adults using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying BPF-induced diabetes through integrated network toxicology, molecular docking, and mediation analysis. After adjusting for confounders including sex, age, race, and education level, a statistically significant association was observed between BPF exposure and diabetes prevalence (OR = 1.04, P = 0.032). Stratified analyses revealed age-dependent metabolic heterogeneity: BPF exposure exhibited a linear association with diabetes in individuals under 50 years (OR = 1.05, P = 0.042), while a non-linear association was observed in those aged 50 and above (P-overall = 0.000876; P-nonlinear = 0.031). Network toxicology and molecular docking analyses indicated that BPF may impair insulin resistance and lipid metabolism by interacting with key proteins (FN1, GAPDH, TP53) through stable hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking, with binding affinities ranging from -5.1 to -7.0 kcal/mol. Mediation analysis suggested a potential suppressive effect of triglycerides on the association between BPF and diabetes in older adults (≥50 years), although the indirect effect was not statistically significant (IE = -0.008, 95 % CI: -0.019-0.003, P = 0.142). The negative mediation proportion (-12.1 %) indicated that the positive direct effect of BPF on diabetes (DE = 0.073, 95 % CI: 0.007-0.14, P = 0.031) was masked by triglycerides. These findings provide novel epidemiological and mechanistic insights into the link between BPF exposure and diabetes risk, underscoring the necessity for rigorous safety assessment of BPA substitutes in consumer plastics.",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2025
41027184,FAM3B activates hepatic stellate cells to accelerate hepatic fibrosis by promoting glucose metabolism.,"This study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of FAM3B (family with sequence similarity 3 member B) in hepatic fibrosis. Bioinformatics analysis, immunohistochemistry, Masson staining, and immunofluorescence detection revealed that the expression of FAM3B was significantly elevated in human hepatic fibrosis tissues and positively correlated with serum HBV DNA load and collagen deposition. Using lentiviral overexpression of FAM3B in the HSC-T6 cell model and siRNA knockdown experiments, we confirmed that FAM3B overexpression promotes hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation by enhancing glucose metabolism (indicated by increased glucose uptake, upregulation of key glycolytic enzymes GLUT1, GLUT3, HK2, LDHA, PFKP, and PKM2, elevated extracellular acidification rate, and increased lactate production) and upregulating HK2 promoter transcriptional activity. This leads to increased α-SMA and COL1α1 expression, enhanced cell proliferation, and suppressed apoptosis, effects that were reversed by the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). In vivo, FAM3B overexpression exacerbated CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver fibrosis and collagen deposition in mice, while 2-DG intervention significantly alleviated this process. CONCLUSION: FAM3B accelerates HSC activation and hepatic fibrosis progression by enhancing glucose metabolism.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2025
41026775,Notch1 Mutation Represents a Potential Therapeutic Target to Enhance Immune Recognition in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"Notch1, a tumor suppressor gene, is one of the most frequently mutated genes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Therefore, it is clinically important to investigate the effects of Notch1 mutations on antitumor immunity in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a subset of HNSCC. This study investigated Notch1 mutations and the expression of immune-related proteins. We also examined the influence of Notch1 mutations on the immune microenvironment using a public database. We examined the expression of Notch1-4 in OSCC cell lines using qPCR. After Notch1 knockdown, OSCC cell proliferation and migration were analyzed using CCK8 and wound healing assays, respectively. Localization of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was assessed by western blot and flow cytometry, while PD-L1 expression was evaluated by western blot. In the somatic mutation analysis of 47 OSCC patients, the relationship between tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and PD-L1 expression was analyzed using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Furthermore, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed using multiple online bioinformatics tools to compare the characteristics of Notch1 mutations in HNSCC. The expression of Notch1 varied depending on the OSCC cell line phenotype, and Notch1 mutation was significantly correlated with tumor growth but not with tumor infiltration. In Notch1 knockdown, PD-L1 expression on the tumor cell surface increased, while cytoplasmic PD-L1 expression decreased. Among the 47 OSCC patients analyzed, seven (14%) had Notch1 mutations. Of those, five patients (71%) exhibited high tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and Notch1 mutation. Online bioinformatics analysis using the xCell algorithm revealed that Notch1-mutated tumors had significantly higher levels of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to Notch1 wild-type tumors. These findings highlight Notch1 mutation as a potential therapeutic target for immune recognition in OSCC.","Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",2025
41026719,High throughput transcriptomics analysis of ovine mammary epithelial cells stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus in vitro.,"In sheep, the innate immune response of mammary epithelial cells (MECs) plays a central role in combating mastitis, yet our understanding of their resistance mechanisms remains limited. This study aimed to elucidate the gene expression profiles of ovine MECs following in vitro stimulation with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) using RNA-Seq technology. Bioinformatics analysis identified a total of 175 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 172 up-regulated and 3 down-regulated genes in the stimulated group compared to the non-stimulated control group. Gene ontology annotation and functional pathway analysis indicated that these DEGs are primarily involved in ribosomal functions, which are essential for protein synthesis and first target of pathogens, as well as in immune response dysregulations, infection, phagocytosis, and bacterial invasion of epithelial cells. Validation via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed the RNA-Seq results. Our results revealed that DEGs converged on innate immune pathways (TLR, NOD-like receptor, NF-κB, MAPK), cytoskeletal remodeling and translational control, indicating inflammatory activation and cell injury in oMECs and highlighting candidate targets for mastitis resistance selection against S. aureus. These findings significantly contribute to the understanding of how ovine MECs respond to S. aureus stimulation, providing a foundation for further research, particularly regarding the immune defense mechanisms, strategies and implications in dairy industry.",PloS one,2025

Current serological diagnostics using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens often exhibit cross-reactivity, reducing diagnostic specificity. This study aimed to develop multiepitope fusion proteins based on <i>Brucella</i> B-cell epitopes using bioinformatics tools and the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) to enhance diagnostic accuracy. B-cell epitopes from major <i>Brucella</i> outer membrane proteins and other antigenic proteins were predicted using bioinformatics tools (BepiPred, ABCpred, and IEDB). Two fusion proteins were designed and produced. The diagnostic performance of the two fusion proteins was evaluated using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with 198 small ruminant serum samples and 232 bovine serum samples in comparison with conventional LPS and Rose Bengal antigen. Sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity were evaluated. Both fusion proteins exhibited high sensitivity and specificity. For ruminant samples, Fusion Protein 2 achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9849, with sensitivity and specificity of 93.90% and 97.26%, respectively. For bovine samples, it showed an AUC of 0.9664, sensitivity of 92.71%, and specificity of 90.44%. Minimal cross-reactivity with other pathogens was observed, indicating high diagnostic specificity. The developed multiepitope fusion proteins demonstrated superior diagnostic performance. These proteins provide a novel tool for rapid and accurate diagnosis of brucellosis, with potential applications in vaccine development and disease control. Future work will focus on optimizing fusion protein design and expanding clinical validation.IMPORTANCEBrucellosis, a zoonotic disease caused by <i>Brucella</i> spp., poses a significant threat to livestock industries and human health.

41025657,Comprehensive profiling of lysine lactylation in <i>Candida albicans</i> and exploratory analysis of fluconazole tolerance associations.,"<i>Candida albicans</i> is the primary pathogen of invasive candidiasis in most regions worldwide, but the therapy options for <i>C. albicans</i> infections are limited, and drug tolerance further exacerbates the treatment challenges. Lysine lactylation (Kla), a recently identified post-translational modification (PTM), is observed in numerous organisms; however, the role of Kla in <i>C. albicans</i> remains unknown. Hence, we report the first proteomic analysis of this specific modification in <i>C. albicans</i> and discuss its potential roles in drug tolerance of <i>C. albicans</i>. Altogether, 7,233 lactylation sites on 1,608 lactylated proteins were identified in <i>C. albicans</i>, with the highest degree of lactylation among the species studied so far. The further bioinformatics analysis revealed that the lactylated proteins were implicated in a variety of cellular functions with diverse subcellular localizations. Additionally, we found a unique survival mode of tolerant cells in the presence of fluconazole, which will be subject to a more thorough investigation in our future studies. This paper is the first report on the lactylome of <i>Candida</i> spp. and provides a reliable foundation for further research on Kla in <i>C. albicans</i> and other human pathogens. This is the first report on the lactylome of <i>Candida</i> spp., and it provides some valuable insights for further research on lactylation in <i>C. albicans</i> and other human pathogens. Moreover, the observations in tolerant cells have prompted plausible hypotheses regarding the potential role of lactylation in mediating <i>C. albicans</i> tolerance to fluconazole, thereby offering a conceptual framework for subsequent investigations. Notably, fungal tolerance to azoles, a concept distinct from resistance, represents a critical phenomenon in <i>C. albicans</i> with profound clinical implications, as it directly correlates with therapeutic failure and persistent infections.",Microbiology spectrum,2025
41025585,Bioinformatic Analysis and Recombinant Expression of the Stonustoxin β-Subunit for Polyclonal Antibody Development.,"Stonefish (Synanceia spp.) are among the most venomous marine organisms. Their venom contains stonustoxin (SNTX), a heterodimeric toxin that induces severe hemolytic and myotoxic effects primarily mediated by its β-subunit. To produce a recombinant SNTX β-subunit and develop neutralizing polyclonal antibodies against SNTX. A DNA cassette encoding immunogenic regions of the β-sntx was designed using bioinformatics analysis, and codon-optimized for expression in E. coli. The construct was cloned into pET17b vector, and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant protein was purified via Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. For antibody production, rabbits were immunized subcutaneously with the recombinant protein emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed by booster doses at 2-week intervals. Antiserum was purified using protein G chromatography, and antibody titers were assessed by indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Epitope mapping revealed key immunogenic regions within residues 124-654 of the β-SNTX subunit. Following codon optimization, the codon adaptation index (CAI) increased to 0.93. Recombinant protein production was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot demonstrating successful purification of a 73 kDa recombinant protein (including TRX/His-tags), with a yield of 40 mg/L. Immunization of rabbits elicited a strong polyclonal IgG response, with antibody titers reaching 1:25,600 following the third booster. Purified IgG (1.8 mg/mL) exhibited high sensitivity in ELISA, detecting the recombinant β-SNTX at concentrations as low as 31.25 ng. The recombinant β-SNTX subunit demonstrated strong immunogenicity, inducing high-affinity antibodies with specific binding activity against the native toxin. The resulting antiserum demonstrated significant neutralization potential, highlighting its promise for antivenom development.",Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,2025
41025463,UAMRL: Multi-Granularity Uncertainty-Aware Multimodal Representation Learning for Drug-Target Affinity Prediction.,"Computational prediction of drug-target affinity (DTA) plays a critical role in modern drug discovery. However, the limited interpretability of traditional deep learning models and the heterogeneity of multimodal data from compounds and proteins hinder their reliability in practical drug development applications. We propose a novel Uncertainty-aware Multimodal Representation Learning (UAMRL) framework to address these challenges. UAMRL employs a dual-stream encoder to learn cross-modal association mappings between drugs and targets in a latent space and integrates heterogeneous information from different modalities. Moreover, an uncertainty quantification mechanism based on the Normal-Inverse-Gamma distribution is introduced to model the reliability of heterogeneous information and suppress less trustworthy contributions during fusion. Experiments show that UAMRL achieves superior predictive accuracy on multiple public DTA datasets, improving both prediction performance and decision transparency.

41024853,ECM Protein CYR61 Promotes Migration and Osteoblastic Differentiation of Irradiation BMSCs via Migrasomes.,"Osteoradionecrosis of the jaw (ORNJ) is a complication of radiation therapy that can lead to hard-to-repair bone defects. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have been identified as potential ""seeds"" for restoring bone defects. In this study, we reported extracellular matrix protein cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61) to enhance the migratory and osteogenic functions of irradiated BMSCs (IR BMSCs) by migrasomes. Various assays, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), apoptosis analysis, qRT-PCR, western blot, ALP staining, alizarin red S (ARS) staining, wound healing assay, transwell assay, and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) were conducted to assess the optimal radiation dose for generating IR BMSCs and migrasome functionality. Proteomics, bioinformatics analysis, gene transfection, and molecular docking were employed to identify key molecules mediating migration and osteoblastic differentiation and its downstream mechanisms. Furthermore, confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot were utilized to identify migrasomes. Results showed that a radiation dose of 2 Gy inhibited migratory and osteogenic abilities of cells without significantly affecting viability. CYR61 emerged as a pivotal molecule regulating BMSC migration and osteoblastic differentiation through binding to integrin αvβ3 at the 125th aspartic acid and activating the ERK signaling pathway. We discovered that migrasomes are the key vehicle effectively delivering CYR61 to restore migration and osteogenesis of IR BMSCs. In conclusion, migrasomes-secreted CYR61 facilitating a promotional effect can regulate the migration and osteogenesis of IR BMSCs. Thus, migrasomes-origin CYR61 may serve as potential therapeutic agents for repairing ORNJ-related bone defects.",Stem cells international,2025
41024644,TMTCrunch: A Proteomic Atlas of Alternative Splicing for Predicting Splicing-Induced Implications in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia with incompletely understood pathogenesis. A major gap arises from the lack of proteomics tools capable of characterizing alternative splicing (AS)-derived proteoforms and their contributions to neurodegeneration. We developed a novel bioinformatics pipeline, TMTCrunch, tailored for rigorous quantitative meta-analysis of big proteomics data at the splice-proteoform level. TMTCrunch characterizes each proteoform by unique peptides, assessing similarity to canonical peptides and unique peptide coverage, employing SMD-based quantitation, and predicting proteoform-specific alterations of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and novel post-translational modifications (PTMs) on spliced peptides. Applying TMTCrunch to 420 brain samples, we constructed the first atlas of splicing translatomes in AD, reproducibly identifying 870 noncanonical proteoforms. Differential analysis suggests splicing affecting proteoforms implicated in cytoskeletal regulation (e.g., MAPT, CLU, DPYSL3, ACTN2, SORBS1, FHL1), glutamatergic transmission (GRIA3), pre-mRNA splicing regulation (ARL6IP4), potassium channel modulation (DPP6), and cAMP signaling (PDE4D). Our analysis predicts disruption of PPIs within the Rho GTPase and EGFR signaling pathways and PTMs (deamidation, oxidation, phosphorylation) within AS regions, regardless of disease state. This approach implicates specific proteoforms in neurodegeneration: DPP6 (P42658-2), GRIA3 (P42263-2), the three-repeat isoforms of tau (3R-MAPT), and ASPH (Q12797-7). This study provides new insights into linking splicing to neurodegeneration.",Journal of proteome research,2025
41024622,WTAP Promotes Malignant Progression and Immune Escape of Glioblastoma by Regulating N6-methyladenosine Modification of CENPF.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant tumor. It has been shown that centromere protein F (CENPF) may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker for glioma patients, while Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) is frequently upregulated across various cancers. However, the specific roles of CENPF and WTAP in GBM remain largely undefined. The differently expressed genes in GBM and expression levels of CENPF and WTAP were analyzed using bioinformatics analysis. The gene expression was examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot. The cell counting kit-8 (CCK8), flow cytometry, transwell, and wound healing assays were used to detect cell viability, apoptosis, invasion, and migration, respectively. The volume and weight of xenograft tumors in mice were detected, and Ki-67, Cleaved caspase-3, and CENPF levels were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined by immunofluorescence (IF) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL), respectively. RMBase v3.0 website was used to predict the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation modification sites of CENPF. The relationship between WTAP and CENPF was analyzed using the RNA-protein binding sites prediction (RBP) website and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Additionally, the m6A methylation levels of CENPF were detected using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (Me-RIP). In GBM cells and tissues, CENPF expression was increased. Furthermore, CENPF promoted cell viability, invasion, and migration, and inhibited apoptosis and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity in GBM. In vivo, CENPF promoted the growth of mice tumors. Mechanistically, WTAP regulated the expression of CENPF via m6A modification. Moreover, WTAP facilitated GBM progression and immune escape through upregulating CENPF. Together, WTAP promotes cell malignant progression and immune escape in GBM through regulating m6A modification of CENPF. These findings may provide a novel theoretical basis for the treatment of GBM.",Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,2025

Computing millions of estimates in large cohorts in which small effect sizes and tight confidence intervals are expected, necessitates minimizing model-misspecification bias to increase power and control false discoveries. We present TarGene, a unified statistical workflow for the semi-parametric efficient and double robust estimation of genetic effects including $ k $-point interactions among categorical variables in the presence of confounding and weak population dependence. $ k $-point interactions, or Average Interaction Effects (AIEs), are a direct generalization of the usual average treatment effect (ATE). We estimate genetic effects with cross-validated and/or weighted versions of Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimators (TMLE) and One-Step Estimators (OSE). The effect of dependence among data units on variance estimates is corrected by using sieve plateau variance estimators based on genetic relatedness across the units. We present extensive realistic simulations to demonstrate power, coverage, and control of type I error. Our motivating application is the targeted estimation of genetic effects on trait, including two-point and higher-order gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, in large-scale genomic databases such as UK Biobank and All of Us. All cross-validated and/or weighted TMLE and OSE for the AIE $ k $-point interaction, as well as ATEs, conditional ATEs and functions thereof, are implemented in the general purpose Julia package TMLE.jl.

41024311,"C-X-C chemokine receptor family genes in osteosarcoma: expression profiles, regulatory networks, and functional impact on tumor progression.","In this comprehensive study, we explored the molecular landscape C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR) family genes (CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5, and CXCR7) in osteosarcoma (OS) by scrutinizing the expression profiles and functional implications using Bioinformatics analyses and molecular experiments. We found significant up-regulation of these genes in OS cell lines compared to control cell lines, as assessed by RT-qPCR, with high diagnostic potential demonstrated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Cross-validation using the GSE12865 dataset revealed consistent up-regulation of CXCR family genes in OS samples, alongside decreased promoter methylation in tumor samples compared to normal tissues, as confirmed by the UALCAN database. Mutational analysis, conducted using data from 237 OS samples from the cBioPortal database, revealed minimal mutations in CXCR1 and CXCR2, with no alterations in CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5, and CXCR7. Copy number variation (CNV) analysis showed some level of amplification in CXCR1 and CXCR2, but no significant alterations in the copy numbers of the other genes. Survival analysis using meta-analysis across multiple independent studies showed that the expression of some CXCR genes were significantly associated with poor patient survival. Further exploration of the transcriptional regulation of CXCR genes using the ENCORI database revealed an intricate miRNA-mRNA network involving miR-130a, miR-146a, miR-155, miR-21, and miR-7, which regulate the expression of these genes. Elevated expression of these miRNAs in OS samples was validated by RT-qPCR, with promising diagnostic potential highlighted by ROC analysis. Additionally, the immunological analysis revealed a positive correlation between the expressions of CXCR genes and immune cell types, including macrophages and T cells, and CXCR genes were found to enhance drug responsiveness in OS patients. Gene enrichment analysis identified critical biological processes and pathways, such as chemokine-mediated signaling and immune response, linked to the CXCR family. Knockdown of CXCR1 in HOS and MG-63 cells confirmed that CXCR1 plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. CXCR1 knockdown significantly reduced cell proliferation and colony formation, while enhancing cell migration, underscoring its functional importance in OS progression. Overall, our findings suggest that the CXCR family genes are potential diagnostic and prognostic markers in OS, with implications for therapeutic targeting and further investigation into their role in OS pathogenesis.",Hereditas,2025
41024294,Decoding the lactylation-immune link in calcific aortic valve disease: a comprehensive bioinformatics approach.,"Calcific aortic valve disease is a progressive disorder characterized by pathological leaflet thickening and calcification. Early disease features include immune cell infiltration and metabolic dysregulation, which persist throughout disease progression. Recent studies implicate aberrant glycolysis and lactate accumulation in CAVD pathogenesis, though mechanistic insights remain limited. We analyzed bulk RNA-seq data (GSE76717, GSE235995, GSE153555) and applied machine learning algorithms to identify lactylation-related hub genes in calcific aortic valve disease. Functional enrichment, correlation analysis, single-gene Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and immune infiltration profiling were performed to elucidate the functional roles of lactylation-related hub genes. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing data were integrated to evaluate lactylation-related gene expression across cell types, quantify lactylation scores, and correlate these scores with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Besides, single-cell samples were stratified by calcification severity (mild vs. severe) to assess the lactylation levels of distinct cell populations during disease progression. Our multi-dimensional analysis revealed eight lactylation-related hub genes (CRABP2, SOD1, PFN1, MBD2, ARGLU1, ALB, ALDH1A1, THRAP3) with significant differential expression in calcific aortic valve disease. These genes correlated with RUNX2 upregulation, immune cell infiltration, and metabolic pathways (glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation). Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of 47,328 cells revealed elevated lactylation scores in valvular interstitial cells, dendritic cells and M1 macrophages during severe calcification, thereby establishing a correlation between lactylation and MYC-driven metabolic reprogramming. This study systematically elucidates the dynamic relationship between immune cell infiltration and lactylation levels during calcific aortic valve disease progression. These findings provide novel perspectives for understanding the molecular mechanisms of calcific aortic valve disease and highlight potential therapeutic targets for clinical intervention.

Although antibiotics are the current choice of treatment for these infections, bacteriophage (phage) therapy has been used with success against Staphylococcus since the dawn of phage therapy. In 2020 a new coagulase-negative species named Staphylococcus borealis was described in Norway. In this study, we focused on understanding phage infections in S. borealis. First, we predict the presence of prophages and phage-defence mechanisms in the genomes of a collection of twelve S. borealis strains by bioinformatics. We also attempted to isolate S. borealis-infecting phages from Norwegian samples and tested the host-range of three known staphylococcal phages against a panel of fifty Norwegian staphylococcal strains. The presence of prophages and phage defence systems was verified in all tested S. borealis strains. No local Norwegian phages could be obtained in a phage isolation attempt targeted towards S. borealis. The host range analysis shows that phage ISP, originally isolated in the 1920s and still used for phage therapy to date, can infect S. capitis and the S. borealis Hus23 strain. Phage ISP was shown to limit S. borealis Hus23 growth in liquid cultures and lower the formation of biofilm by the bacterium. The efficiency of plating of phage ISP can be improved by repeated passages in the new S. borealis Hus23 host. here we expand the known host range of the traditional phage ISP by showing that it also infects S. borealis and can be adapted to the new host by serial passages, showcasing the flexibility of phages as an antimicrobial strategy.",Virology journal,2025
41024189,Investigating the effect of tenuigenin on LPS-induced HPMEC dysfunction by inhibiting SRC activation based on network pharmacology and molecular docking.,"Adult pneumonia is an infectious lung disease caused by bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms and exhibits some degree of contagion. Tenuigenin, a bioactive compound derived from Polygala tenuifolia, possesses broad pharmacological effects, but its role in adult pneumonia remains incompletely understood. Bioinformatics and database analysis were employed to screen and analyze the Tenuigenin target genes relevant to adult pneumonia. Cell functions were assessed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK8), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, transwell, tube formation, Fluo-4 calcium assay, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) assays. Protein levels were measured by western blot. Network pharmacology and molecular docking were employed to screen core target genes and verify binding interactions. Tenuigenin targets in adult pneumonia were enriched in the pathways related to vascular permeability and calcium signaling. Tenuigenin mitigated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced impairment of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (HPMEC) viability, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, while attenuating LPS-induced increases in apoptosis, calcium ion, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Besides, Tenuigenin also attenuated the TER decrease and permeability increase caused by LPS exposure in HPMECs. Network pharmacology and molecular docking identified steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) as a core target of Tenuigenin, demonstrating binding to specific SRC amino acid residues. Tenuigenin also reduced LPS-induced increase in phosphor-SRC (p-SRC) expression. Crucially, after inhibition of SRC kinase activity, Tenuigenin no longer exerted significant protective effects against LPS-induced HPMEC injury and dysfunction.

41024164,BRD-K20733377 inhibits ferroptosis and alleviates intervertebral disc degeneration via the STAT3/NFKB1 axis: a multiapproach study.,"Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is one of the main causes of low back pain. Existing literature has confirmed the occurrence of ferroptosis in IVDD. With the widespread application of artificial intelligence (AI), an increasing number of compounds have been screened for their potential to alleviate IVDD. BRD-K20733377 is one such compound with anti-aging properties. Preliminary experiments have shown that BRD-K20733377 can significantly inhibit cellular ferroptosis. However, research on the potential therapeutic targets and mechanisms of BRD-K20733377 in IVDD remains limited. This study aims to explore the main targets and potential mechanisms of BRD-K20733377 in the treatment of IVDD. Network pharmacology, bioinformatics, machine learning algorithms, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and Mendelian randomization were used to comprehensively analyze the effects, potential targets, and mechanisms of BRD-K20733377 in IVDD. Rat nucleus pulposus-derived mesenchymal stem cells (NPMSCs) were selected for in vitro experiments. Cell viability was measured by CCK-8 and flow cytometry, while antioxidant defense, lipid peroxidation, and iron metabolism were explored using JC-1, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), FerroOrange dye, Lipid peroxides, Malondialdehyde (MDA), and Mitochondrial transmission electron microscopy. The expression levels of ferroptosis-related proteins were detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence. In the rat IVDD model, the effects of BRD-K20733377 on pain threshold, pain behavior, and its therapeutic efficacy were evaluated. Predictive results identified 30 genes related to ferroptosis in BRD-K20733377 and IVDD, revealing that the potential mechanism of BRD-K20733377 in treating IVDD is closely associated with ferroptosis. In addition, functional enrichment analysis indicated that these genes are involved in multiple signaling pathways. Machine learning algorithms further identified the core targets STAT3 and NFKB1, and Mendelian randomization validated their direct causal relationship with IVDD. In vitro experiments confirmed that BRD-K20733377 inhibited IVDD by reducing intracellular Fe²⁺ levels and lipid peroxidation, thus regulating ferroptosis. Theoretically, BRD-K20733377 may inhibit NPMSCs ferroptosis via STAT3/NFKB1 axis. Ferroptosis-related proteins and immunofluorescence results further supported this mechanism. In vivo experiments showed that BRD-K20733377 significantly improved the behavior of SD rats, reduced pain scores, and alleviated IVDD. BRD-K20733377 inhibits ferroptosis through the STAT3/NFKB1 axis, thereby alleviating IVDD. This provides a new perspective for the study of IVDD and could serve as a potential therapeutictarget for IVDD.",Stem cell research & therapy,2025
41024157,MSCs-EXOs containing miR-21a-5p promoted cell proliferation in the rat retinal Müller cell rMC-1 via targeting LATS1.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in adults, which is characterized by neurovascular dysfunction. Retinal neurodegeneration was involved in the pathogenesis of early-stage DR. This research aims to reveal the therapeutic effects and potential molecule mechanism of Mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes (MSCs-EXOs) in Müller cells at the early stage of DR. More specifically, we investigated in the rat retinal Müller cell line rMC-1. We cultured rMC-1 in high glucose (HG) medium mixed with MSCs-EXOs to observe the changes in cell proliferative capacity and function. EdU assay, Immunofluorescence staining and Cell viability were used to assess cell proliferative capacity and function. Western blot and Quantitative Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were used to assess the expression of cell proliferation-related proteins and cell cycle-related protein. Finally, dual-luciferase reporter assay, miRNA sequencing and cell transfection were used to assess the relationships between MSCs-EXOs and binding site. Here our results displayed that MSCs-EXOs promoted HG-induced cell proliferation in rMC-1. Furthermore, MSCs-EXOs protected HG-induced function of rMC-1. Mechanistically, MSCs-EXOs promoted the proliferation of rMC-1 by inhibiting the Hippo pathway to decrease the expression of Large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) and p-YAP and increase the expression of cell proliferation-related proteins Yes-associated protein (YAP), EGFR and cell cycle-related protein CYCLIN D1. In addition, LATS1 knockdown inhibited p-YAP expression and promoted HG-induced cell proliferation and YAP, EGFR and CYCLIN D1 expression in rMC-1. We subsequently performed bioinformatics sequencing analysis of MSCs-EXOs and confirmed that LATS1 was the target of miR-21a-5p. Our research proved that MSCs-EXOs containing miR-21a-5p increased the expression of YAP via targeting LATS1, and ultimately promoted the cell proliferation in rMC-1. Our current study clarified the molecular mechanism of MSCs-EXOs-regulated cell proliferation and function protection in rMC-1 and provided a novel strategy for the treatment of DR.",Stem cell research & therapy,2025
41024147,KDM4A-driven SMAD5/TGFβ axis activation as a therapeutic target in cholangiocarcinoma: mechanistic insights and translational implications.,"Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignancy with poor prognosis and increasing incidence in recent years. Apart from early surgical resection, other treatments have shown limited efficacy. Lysine-specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A), a histone demethylase, is known to have a promotional effect on a variety of tumours. However, its impact on cholangiocarcinoma remains underexplored. The expression differences of KDM4A in cholangiocarcinoma and adjacent tissues were analyzed by database and tissue microarray. The effects of KDM4A on the growth and proliferation ability of cholangiocarcinoma cells were explored through subcutaneous tumor formation experiments in nude mice and cholangiocarcinoma mouse models. The regulatory role of KDM4A on TGFβ pathway was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot experiments. Bioinformatics methods were employed to predict KDM4A binding, which was validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. KDM4A was highly expressed in cholangiocarcinoma tissues compared with normal tissues, and KDM4A significantly promoted the proliferation and invasion ability of cholangiocarcinoma. KDM4A positively regulated SMAD5, upregulating its expression and subsequently promoting the expression of TGFβ pathway target genes ID1 and ID2. Knockdown of SMAD5 could reverse the biological effects caused by KDM4A. The expression of SMAD5 was regulated by the histone methylation mark H3K9me3. KDM4A was enriched at the SMAD5 gene promoter region, downregulated H3K9me3 marks, and thus promoted SMAD5 transcription. KDM4A inhibitor can inhibit the proliferation and invasive ability of cholangiocarcinoma through the aforementioned mechanisms. Treatment of cholangiocarcinoma model mice with a KDM4A inhibitor resulted in significantly reduced liver volume and lesion area in the treatment group compared to the control group. In summary, KDM4A promotes the development of cholangiocarcinoma by regulating SMAD5 to activate the TGFβ pathway. The KDM4A inhibitor JIB-04 shows potential in inhibiting cholangiocarcinoma progression, providing a rationale for the epigenetic therapy of cholangiocarcinoma.",Cell & bioscience,2025
41040840,Elaborating the Role of Narrative and Self-Determination Theory in Video Game Design Research.,"Narratives, defined as stories involving two or more events arranged in a chronological or causal sequence, are fundamental and ubiquitous characteristics of human communication and serve as an integral feature of many video games. Moreover, narratives can be understood in nuanced ways through the lens of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Yet, the intersection of SDT and video game narratives has been surprisingly underexplored. This article reviews research on narrative media and examines how narratives can be integrated into games from the perspective of SDT and potential boundary conditions. We then explore how concepts from narrative theories and SDT can be integrated. The goal of this integration is to help guide future game design and identify new questions for future research related to: (1) the integration of parable narratives in video games, specifically parable narratives featuring characters' personal transformation and growth and (2) predicting which video games people choose and prefer. We argue that scholars working with narrative theories and SDT can collaborate to advance video game research.",Interacting with computers,2024
41037558,ZonAware: Identifying Zoning Out and Increasing Engagement in Upper Limb Virtual Reality Rehabilitation.,"Zoning out, a form of cognitive disengagement, seriously challenges the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) based upper limb rehabilitation. As therapy often involves repetitive tasks requiring sustained attention, undetected lapses in focus can reduce motor learning, engagement, and overall recovery outcomes. This research addresses this gap by proposing ZonAware, a novel strategy integrating real-time zoning out detection with adaptive intervention to enhance user engagement during VR rehabilitation. ZonAware identifies zoning out using five eye-tracking metrics: blink frequency, blink duration, pupil size, eye openness, and gaze duration. These signals are analysed through lightweight statistical models (Z-Score, Boxplot, and Modified Z-Score), with a hard voting mechanism producing binary classifications in real-time. Upon detection, a pattern changing intervention subtly modulates task difficulty by temporarily increasing, then decreasing it, to regain user focus without breaking immersion. Three user studies involving 70 healthy participants and 22 patients demonstrated the strategy's effectiveness. ZonAware achieved 98.24% detection accuracy with low latency (82-150 ms), reducing zoning out frequency by 53.57% and shortening disengagement duration from 18.1 to 4.8 seconds. The approach also improved user engagement, performance, and emotional motivation. ZonAware delivers one of the first real-time zoning out solutions for VR rehabilitation, offering an interpretable, theory-driven approach that enhances attention, engagement, and adaptability in human-computer interaction.",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2025

41035905,"Applications and interrelationships of brain function detection, brain-computer interfaces, and brain stimulation: a comprehensive review.","Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), Brain Function Detection (BFD), and Brain Stimulation (BS) are three pivotal technological domains in neuroscience and neuroengineering. Each plays a critical role in fundamental research, clinical applications, and human-computer interaction paradigms. Despite their distinct developmental pathways and application focuses, these technologies are frequently conflated or ambiguously referenced in both academic discourse and industrial practice, potentially leading to conceptual misinterpretations, suboptimal system designs, and clinical misapplications. Prior literature reviews have predominantly concentrated on BCI as a standalone subject, covering its historical evolution, specific neurophysiological signal modalities, or emergent technological trends. This manuscript's core contribution is critiquing the overuse of ""passive BCI"" (labeling feedback-absent monitoring as BCI). Through an application-oriented lens, it clarifies boundaries between BCI, BFD, and BS to resolve conceptual confusion. Further, the review interrogates the convergences and divergences among these modalities and critically evaluates the practical feasibility and challenges associated with their integrative deployment in clinical and experimental settings. Ultimately, this work aspires to provide a lucid, systematic, and conceptually coherent framework to support neuroscientific novices, interdisciplinary investigators, and clinical practitioners. By fostering precise comprehension and judicious utilization of BCI, BFD, and BS, it aims to propel their standardized advancement and enhance their translational impact across both research and clinical domains.",Cognitive neurodynamics,2025

Previous studies have primarily explored the binary relationship between perpetrators and victims, with limited research examining the emotional exhaustion of bullying roles from the perspectives of victims and bystanders. Therefore, this study recruited 597 participants and conducted a scenario-based experiment to investigate whether generative AI can alleviate the poor work states of bullying roles in the medical workplace, thereby demonstrating the interaction between generative AI's information delivery methods and bullying roles in relation to emotional exhaustion. The results showed that bullying roles in the medical workplace significantly influence emotional exhaustion, with victims experiencing significantly higher levels than bystanders. Moreover, generative AI's information delivery methods can effectively moderate the work states of victims. Thus, this study advances the field of human-computer interaction by shifting its focus from functional adaptation to emotional ecology.

40990372,How Well Do Older Adult Fitness Technologies Match User Needs and Preferences? Scoping Review of 2014-2024 Literature.,"The population is aging, and research on maintaining older adult independent living is growing in interest. Digital technologies have been developed to support older adults' independent living through fitness. However, reviews of current fitness technologies for older adults indicate that the success is considerably limited. This scoping review investigates older adult fitness by comparing current interventions to known needs and preferences of older adults from older adult-specific technology acceptance research, barriers and enablers to physical activity, and qualitative research on fitness technologies. The review questions are (1) How well do current older adult fitness technologies align with known preferences? (2) How well do current research methodologies evaluate the known needs and preferences? Research papers from the last 10 years were searched in the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Medline, and PsycINFO databases using keywords related to older adults, technology, and exercise. Papers were only included if they specifically evaluated fitness technologies, focused on older adults, and mentioned a specific technology used in the intervention. To evaluate the fitness interventions, an assessment tool, the Older Adult Fitness Technology Translation Assessment tool, was synthesized through literature on technology acceptance, barriers and enablers to physical activity, and qualitative research on fitness technologies. Interventions were scored by 5 reviewers using a dual-review approach. A total of 43 research papers were selected:16 from medical journals, 15 from engineering journals, 7 from human-computer interaction journals, 3 from public health, and 2 from combined computing and engineering journals. The Older Adult Fitness Technology Translation Assessment tool contained six assessment factors: (1) compatibility with lifestyle, (2) similarity with experience, (3) dignity and independence, (4) privacy concerns, (5) social support, and (6) emotion. The average scores of the 6 factors were 2.93 (SD 0.86) on compatibility with lifestyle, 3.10 (SD 0.74) on similarity to experience, 3.49 (SD 0.64) on dignity and independence, 3.17 (SD 0.86) on privacy concerns, 3.74 (SD 0.81) on short-term outcomes, 2.75 (SD 1.21) on long-term outcomes, 2.79 (SD 0.88) on social support, and 3.17 (SD 1.19) on emotion. No research paper scored a 3 or above on all 6 factors. The results show a lack of alignment between the known preferences of older adults and the design and assessment of current older adult fitness technologies. Areas for growth include (1) alignment between the needs of older adults and fitness technology intervention design, (2) translation of findings from older adult design work to designs in practice, and (3) explicit usage of older adult-specific factors in research. We hypothesize that the proposed Older Adult Fitness Technology Translation Assessment tool can help bridge the gap between technological capability and real-world applicability, ultimately fostering greater acceptance, respect, and long-term success.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025

Drawing on structural equation modelling of survey data from 153 instructors, the results show that TPACK significantly predicts AIA, with self-efficacy accounting for this relationship. Drawing on a structural equation model analysis of survey data from 153 English instructors, we demonstrate that TPACK significantly predicts AIA, and self-efficacy played an explanatory role in this relationship. Organisational support further mediates the pathway from AI-Technical Knowledge (AI-TK) to TPACK, highlighting institutional mechanisms that strengthen teachers' pedagogical capacity for AI integration. Three critical pathways are identified: (1) a direct TPACK → AIA trajectory, (2) an AI-TK → OS → TPACK → AIA institutional chain and (3) a TPACK → SE → AIA motivational loop. Positioning AI as a form of assistive technology, the findings highlight its role in enhancing teachers' instructional capacity while promoting accessibility, personalised scaffolding and inclusive opportunities for diverse learners. By integrating Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and assistive technology perspectives, the study reframes TPACK as interaction readiness, organisational support as a socio-technical affordance, and self-efficacy as interaction efficacy. This interdisciplinary framing highlights that AI acceptance is not only a matter of knowledge and psychology, but also of designing human-AI collaborations that promote usability, accessibility and inclusive pedagogy.

This study synthesized from carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) grafted with poly(acrylic acid-co-vinyl imidazole) P(AA-co-VI) and MXene nanosheets, to obtain a multifunctional hydrogel termed C-PAV/MXene. The hydrogel combines the exceptional ductility of CMC with a robust, crosslinked architecture formed by acrylic acid-derived dynamic hydrogen bonds, which enhances mechanical resilience while minimizing volumetric expansion. The inclusion of MXene nanosheets further providing superior electrical conductivity, efficient near-infrared (NIR)-driven photothermal conversion, and inherent antibacterial properties. The synthesized conductive hydrogels demonstrate impressive tensile properties, with an elongation of 964 %, and exhibit high linearity across the entire strain range (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.98). This hydrogel achieves antibacterial efficacy through a dual mechanism that combines quaternary ammonium groups with the physical bactericidal action of MXene. Furthermore, it effectively converts physical signals generated by human motion into corresponding electrical changes, maintaining efficacy even during motion monitoring in aquatic environments. Moreover, it facilitates the transmission of information through Morse code via variations in pressure and strain. This multifunctional hydrogel demonstrates transformative potential for next-generation wearable electronics by addressing critical limitations in strain/pressure sensing applications.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2025
40975866,Designing an mHealth prototype for people with disabilities: insights from co-design and heuristic evaluation.,"The transition from inpatient rehabilitation to community living poses significant challenges for individuals with newly acquired disabilities. Peer navigators, individuals with lived experience, are trained to support this transition; however, accessing in-person services can be difficult. To facilitate remote peer support and ensure accessibility, we co-designed a mobile health (mHealth) app with four peer navigators with disabilities. Over the course of three co-design sessions, we developed personas and iteratively refined low- and high-fidelity prototypes. We then conducted a heuristic evaluation with 22 human-computer interaction students to identify usability flaws. Based on this evaluation and feedback from a follow-up focus group with three students, we implemented iterative improvements to enhance usability and interactivity. This paper discusses the design implications and lessons learned for designing mHealth tools in collaboration with people with disabilities.",Disability and rehabilitation. Assistive technology,2025
40974514,The Effectiveness of Extended Reality Technology Interventions on Vocational Skills for Individuals with Autism and Intellectual Disabilities: A Meta-analysis.,"Extended reality (XR) technology has emerged as a promising tool for vocational training by providing controlled, customizable learning environments. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of XR-based interventions in improving vocational skills for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). A meta-analysis was conducted on 26 eligible studies (N = 642) employing pre-post experimental or controlled experimental designs, selected from an initial pool of 3,52 articles. Moderators included: (1) participants' characteristics (disorder type, age, intelligence quotient, and co-occurring conditions), (2) technical characteristics (level of immersion and human-computer interaction), (3) intervention characteristics (assistance from human interventionist, intervention form, intervention intensity, including frequency, single-session duration, intervention period, total sessions, total duration), (4) target skills, and (5) measurement characteristics (evaluation methods and measurement tools). We found: (1) XR-based interventions demonstrated a medium overall effect size (SMD = 0.73, 95% CI [0.59, 0.87]) for vocational skills training among individuals with ASD and ID. (2) Based on the results of statistical power analysis, subgroup analyses were conducted for target skill types. We found interventions targeting employment outcomes showed significantly lower effect sizes than those targeting job hard skills, job soft skills, and adaptive psychological traits. Additionally, interventions targeting maladaptive psychological traits were significantly less effective than those targeting job soft skills. (3) Based on results of statistical power analysis, meta-regression was conducted for single-session duration and revealed no significant moderating effect. XR-based interventions show promise for improving vocational skills among individuals with ASD and ID, with effectiveness moderated by target skills. This meta-analysis highlights that improving employment for individuals with ASD and ID requires a multi-layered approach. We need to integrate technology optimization with inclusive policies and employment support.",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2025
40969172,EmoShiftNet: a shift-aware multi-task learning framework with fusion strategies for emotion recognition in multi-party conversations.,"Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is vital for applications such as mental health monitoring, virtual assistants, and human-computer interaction. However, existing ERC models often neglect emotion shifts-transitions between emotional states across dialogue turns in multi-party conversations (MPCs). These shifts are subtle, context-dependent, and complicated by class imbalance in datasets such as the Multimodal EmotionLines Dataset (MELD). To address this, we propose EmoShiftNet, a shift-aware multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly performs emotion classification and emotion shift detection. The model integrates multimodal features, including contextualized text embeddings from BERT, acoustic features (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, pitch, loudness), and temporal cues (pause duration, speaker overlap, utterance length). Emotion shift detection is incorporated as an auxiliary task via a composite loss function combining focal loss, binary cross-entropy, and triplet margin loss. Evaluations on the MELD dataset demonstrate that EmoShiftNet achieves higher overall F1-scores than both traditional and graph-based ERC models. In addition, the framework improves the recognition of minority emotions under imbalanced conditions, confirming the effectiveness of incorporating shift supervision and multimodal fusion. These findings highlight the importance of modeling emotional transitions in ERC. By leveraging multi-task learning with explicit shift detection, EmoShiftNet enhances contextual awareness and offers more robust performance for multi-party conversational emotion recognition.",Frontiers in artificial intelligence,2025
40965285,The Influence of Perceived Fairness on Trust in Human-Computer Interaction.,"Fairness is a fundamental principle in human social interactions that influences subsequent behavioural decisions. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent, human-computer interactions have emerged as a new mode of social interaction. This study investigates the differences in fairness perceptions and their impact on trust decisions in human-human and human-AI contexts using a mixed experimental design of 2 (proposer identity: AI/human) × 2 (offer: fair/unfair) × 2 (trustee identity: AI/human). A total of 128 university students participated in the experimental study employing both the Ultimatum Game and the Trust Game paradigms. The results showed that participants who received fair offers had higher trust investment rates and amounts than those who received unfair offers. When offers were unfair, the AI proposer group elicited greater investment willingness, leading to higher trust investment rates than the human proposer group. Conversely, under fair conditions, participants displayed greater risk aversion towards human trustees, investing at lower rates and amounts than with AI trustees. The findings suggest that fairness perceptions in human-computer interactions have a stronger impact on trust decisions than those in human-human interactions.",International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie,2025

Nevertheless, integrating high sensitivity, a broad detection range, and biodegradability remains difficult. Herein, we developed a flexible piezoresistive tactile sensor comprising a gelatin/deep eutectic solvent/sodium citrate (GDS) ionogel substrate, a carbon nanotube (CNT)/gelatin sprayed hierarchical microstructure sensing layer, and a gelatin gel-based interdigitated electrode. The hierarchical microstructures and interdigital microgrooves, fabricated via template transfer printing, mimic the interlocking spinous structures of human skin, enhancing stress distribution and sensitivity. Due to the superior mechanical properties of the GDS ionogel matrix and the ""interlocking effect"" between the microstructures and interdigital electrode, the sensor achieves high sensitivity (6.16 kPa<sup>-1</sup>), broad range (up to 173 kPa), fast response (<10 ms), low detection limit (10 Pa), and excellent cycling stability over 8000 cycles.

40960977,"Cognitive Affordances in Visualization: Related Constructs, Design Factors, and Framework.","Classically, affordance research investigates how the shape of objects communicates actions to potential users. Cognitive affordances, a subset of this research, characterize how the design of objects influences cognitive actions, such as information processing. Within visualization, cognitive affordances inform how graphs' design decisions communicate information to their readers. Although several related concepts exist in visualization, a formal translation of affordance theory to visualization is still lacking. In this paper, we review and translate affordance theory to visualization by formalizing how cognitive affordances operate within a visualization context. We also review common methods and terms, and compare related constructs to cognitive affordances in visualization. Based on a synthesis of research from psychology, human-computer interaction, and visualization, we propose a framework of cognitive affordances in visualization that enumerates design decisions and reader characteristics that influence a visualization's hierarchy of communicated information. Finally, we demonstrate how this framework can guide the evaluation and redesign of visualizations.",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2025
40955500,"Self-Adhesive, Highly Linear Flexible Strain Sensor Designed Using the Thermal Response Countermeasure Principle for a Wide Temperature Domain.","Flexible strain sensors are of great significance in achieving high sensitivity monitoring, expanding the application scope of intelligent devices, and promoting the innovation of human-computer interaction technology. However, variations in environmental temperature frequently lead to signal drift in strain sensing, compromising the stability and accuracy of the measurements. This study exploits the negative temperature coefficient of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) in its temperature response. Through constructing the network cross-linking structure, introducing hydrogen bonding, and modulating metal coordination, the thermal expansion mismatch between PEDOT:PSS and the matrix was effectively mitigated. By balancing the antagonistic effects of the ""negative temperature effect"" (NTC) and ""thermal expansion effect"" (PTC), the insensitive characteristic of the sensing material to temperature changes was achieved. The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of the sample decreased from 40.29 to 0.45%/K. Meanwhile, the modified samples exhibit superior strain-sensing performance, characterized by a broad strain range of 0-50%, excellent linearity, and stable signal output, which is attributed to their self-adhesive property. These samples demonstrate exceptional stability and durability, maintaining a consistent strain-sensing signal after undergoing over 2000 stretching-recovery cycles. Consequently, this study successfully developed a temperature-insensitive flexible strain-sensing material. The sensor's temperature insensitivity and its ability to stably monitor strain emphasize its significant potential for applications in variable temperature environments, particularly in human motion monitoring and health monitoring.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2025
40950462,Factors Influencing the Effectiveness of AI-Assisted Decision-Making in Medicine: A Scoping Review.,"Research on artificial intelligence-based clinical decision-support (AI-CDS) systems has returned mixed results. Sometimes providing AI-CDS to a clinician will improve decision-making performance, sometimes it will not, and it is not always clear why. This scoping review seeks to clarify existing evidence by identifying clinician-level and technology design factors that impact the effectiveness of AI-assisted decision-making in medicine. We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase for peer-reviewed papers that studied factors impacting the effectiveness of AI-CDS. We identified the factors studied and their impact on three outcomes: clinicians' attitudes toward AI, their decisions (e.g., acceptance rate of AI recommendations), and their performance when utilizing AI-CDS. We retrieved 5,850 articles and included 45. Four clinician-level and technology design factors were commonly studied. Expert clinicians may benefit less from AI-CDS than non-experts, with some mixed results. Explainable AI increased clinicians' trust, but could also increase trust in incorrect AI recommendations, potentially harming human-AI collaborative performance. Clinicians' baseline attitudes toward AI predict their acceptance rates of AI recommendations. Of the three outcomes of interest, human-AI collaborative performance was most commonly assessed. Few factors have been studied for their impact on the effectiveness of AI-CDS. Due to conflicting outcomes between studies, we recommend future work should leverage the concept of 'appropriate trust' to facilitate more robust research on AI-CDS, aiming not to increase overall trust in or acceptance of AI but to ensure that clinicians accept AI recommendations only when trust in AI is warranted.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025

However, it remains a challenge to develop hydrogel flexible sensors with excellent mechanical properties, high toughness, high sensitivity and fast response through a simple approach. In this work, hydrophobic associations and cellulose nanofibers were introduced into a polyacrylamide/polyvinyl alcohol (PAM/PVA) dual-network hydrogel. The incorporation of a hydrophobic system strengthens the first polymer network, while cellulose nanofibers (CNF) enhance the second PVA freeze-thaw network. Notably, CNF tightly bridges the dual networks, forming extensive hydrogen bonds with the reinforced double-network structure. Under the synergistic effects of multiple networks and hydrogen bonding interactions, the composite hydrogel exhibits superior mechanical performance (1.82 MPa), outstanding toughness (5.41 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>), excellent fatigue resistance, and good recovery properties. Additionally, the composite hydrogel demonstrates superior electrical conductivity, high sensitivity (GF = 7.89), and stable electrical signal output.

40942843,Redesigning Multimodal Interaction: Adaptive Signal Processing and Cross-Modal Interaction for Hands-Free Computer Interaction.,"Hands-free computer interaction is a key topic in assistive technology, with camera-based and voice-based systems being the most common methods. Recent camera-based solutions leverage facial expressions or head movements to simulate mouse clicks or key presses, while voice-based systems enable control via speech commands, wake-word detection, and vocal gestures. However, existing systems often suffer from limitations in responsiveness and accuracy, especially under real-world conditions. In this paper, we present 3-Modal Human-Computer Interaction (3M-HCI), a novel interaction system that dynamically integrates facial, vocal, and eye-based inputs through a new signal processing pipeline and a cross-modal coordination mechanism. This approach not only enhances recognition accuracy but also reduces interaction latency.

40942706,Development of Machine-Learning-Based Facial Thermal Image Analysis for Dynamic Emotion Sensing.,"Information on the relationship between facial thermal responses and emotional state is valuable for sensing emotion. Yet, previous research has typically relied on linear methods of analysis based on regions of interest (ROIs), which may overlook nonlinear pixel-wise information across the face. To address this limitation, we investigated the use of machine learning (ML) for pixel-level analysis of facial thermal images to estimate dynamic emotional arousal ratings. We collected facial thermal data from 20 participants who viewed five emotion-eliciting films and assessed their dynamic emotional self-reports. Our ML models, including random forest regression, support vector regression, ResNet-18, and ResNet-34, consistently demonstrated superior estimation performance compared to traditional simple or multiple linear regression models for the ROIs. To interpret the nonlinear relationships between facial temperature changes and arousal, saliency maps and integrated gradients were used for the ResNet-34 model. The results show nonlinear associations of arousal ratings in nose = tip, forehead, and cheek temperature changes. These findings imply that ML-based analysis of facial thermal images can estimate emotional arousal more effectively, pointing to potential applications of non-invasive emotion sensing for mental health, education, and human-computer interaction.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025
40939172,A Design Framework for Microintervention Software Technology in Digital Health: Critical Interpretive Synthesis.,"Although many digital health interventions have been studied in human-computer interaction, long-term engagement remains a challenge. Microinterventions that leverage small but meaningful steps toward health outcomes have been proposed as a method for providing flexible and engaging, yet short and focused, interventions. One way to mitigate the potentially limiting scope of each microintervention is through narratives combining multiple different microinterventions over time to facilitate greater effects and engagement. As an emerging field of research, significant focus has thus far been placed on the creation and testing of individual microinterventions with little consideration for the consolidated experience, that is, the narrative over time. A more concise terminology and framework could make it easier to design, evaluate, and compare systems for microinterventions, facilitate collaboration in the field, and foster communication across required disciplines. This paper aims to provide a framework for the creation of microintervention systems and the narratives served by these through their microinterventions. To synthesize a framework, we carried out a critical interpretive synthesis involving reciprocal translational analysis, refutational synthesis, and lines-of-argument synthesis, based on a systematic review of microintervention literature following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines across the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. To assess the resulting framework, we applied it retroactively back onto the literature. Based on a review including 35 studies, of which 80% (n=28) were published after 2020, we present and rationalize the Design for Microintervention Software Technology (D-MIST) framework, which can be used to better classify, design, and evaluate microinterventions. D-MIST defines a microintervention system on three levels: (1) the narrative, (2) the microintervention, and (3) the event. The narrative is the consolidated experience of engaging with multiple microinterventions over time, supporting a narrative goal, for example, a clinical goal. A microintervention is a highly focused intervention consisting of self-contained events aiming to facilitate small but meaningful steps toward the narrative goal. The event attempts a positive momentary change through a resource, for example, an exercise. Events may, for example, be designed for single use, present variations to facilitate engagement, or present order-dependent sequential resources. We additionally discuss supporting constructs, such as decision rules, conceptual models, and the system's interaction model, that is, how the system interacts with the user through its design and other actors to create a consolidated narrative. The resulting D-MIST framework, based on current state-of-the-art literature, describes the components of microintervention systems and how these contribute to a consolidated experience. Based hereon, we suggest opportunities for personalization of microintervention systems, discuss design guidelines, and the roles of actors in creating health narratives aiming to obtain better distal health outcomes.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025

40928921,A Lightweight CNN Approach for Hand Gesture Recognition via GAF Encoding of A-Mode Ultrasound Signals.,"Hand gesture recognition(HGR) is a key technology in human-computer interaction and human communication. This paper presents a lightweight, parameter-free attention convolutional neural network (LPA-CNN) approach leveraging Gramian Angular Field(GAF)transformation of A-mode ultrasound signals for HGR. First, this paper maps 1-dimensional (1D) A-mode ultrasound signals, collected from the forearm muscles of 10 healthy participants, into 2-dimensional (2D) images. Second, GAF is selected owing to its higher sensitivity against Markov Transition Field (MTF) and Recurrence Plot (RP) in HGR. Third, a novel LPA-CNN consisting of four components, i.e., a convolution-pooling block, an attention mechanism, an inverted residual block, and a classification block, is proposed. Among them, the convolution-pooling block consists of convolutional and pooling layers, the attention mechanism is applied to generate 3-D weights, the inverted residual block consists of multiple channel shuffling units, and the classification block is performed through fully connected layers. Fourth, comparative experiments were conducted on GoogLeNet, MobileNet, and LPA-CNN to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that compared to GoogLeNet and MobileNet, LPA-CNN has a smaller model size and better recognition performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 0.98 ± 0.02. This paper achieves efficient and high-accuracy HGR by encoding A-mode ultrasound signals into 2D images and integrating the LPA-CNN model, providing a new technological approach for HGR based on ultrasonic signals.",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2025

However, current research has not yet quantitatively analysed trust-related issues from both the healthcare consumer perspective and the uncertainty perspective of human-computer interaction. This study aims to analyse the antecedents of healthcare consumers' trust in ChatGPT and their adoption intentions towards ChatGPT-generated health information from the perspective of uncertainty reduction. An anonymous online survey was conducted with healthcare customers in China between September and October 2024. This survey included questions on critical constructs such as social influence, situational normality, anthropomorphism, autonomy, personalisation, information quality, information disclosure, trust in ChatGPT, and intention to adopt health information. A 7-point Likert scale was used to score each item, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). SmartPLS 4.0 was used to analyse data and test the proposed theoretical model. The findings indicated that trust in ChatGPT had a significant relationship with the intention to adopt health information. The primary factors associated with trust in ChatGPT and the intention to adopt health information were social influence, situational normality, autonomy, personalisation, and information quality. The analysis revealed a negative relationship between social influence and trust in ChatGPT. Familiarity with ChatGPT was identified as a significant control variable. Trust in ChatGPT is positively related to healthcare consumers' adoption of health information, with information quality as a key predictor. The findings offer empirical support and practical guidance for enhancing trust and encouraging the use of GenAI-generated health information.",Digital health,2025

This study aims to explore the effects of attractions and social attributes of chatbots on users' media dependency and usage intention of chatbots, as well as the role of users' para-social interaction and emotional support gained from chatbots. A total of 1,553 responses were collected based on a cross-sectional online survey. Utilizing the structural equation modeling approach, this study tested the relationships among exogenous variables (social attraction/task attraction, perceived competence/perceived warmth), endogenous variables (usage intention/media dependence), and mediating variables (para-social interaction/emotional support). The results show that the attraction and social attributes of chatbots, represented by ChatGPT, enable users to construct para-social interaction and obtain emotional support when chatting with them. Meanwhile, para-social interaction and emotional support can link users' perceptions of chatbots to their media dependency on and usage intention of them. This study provides theoretical and methodological references for examining the human-robot interaction relationship and offers insights into exploring the human-robot emotional connection. This study explores chatbots from the perspective of emotional connections, emphasizing how users' perceptions of chatbot attraction and social attributes facilitate para-social interaction and emotional support. Theoretically, it extends the application of para-social interaction theory and emotional support into the domain of human-chatbot communication, enriching the understanding of affective mechanisms in human-AI relationships.

40872053,Preparation and Applications of Silver Nanowire-Polyurethane Flexible Sensor.,"To expand the application of silver nanowires (AgNWs) in the field of flexible sensors, this study developed a stretchable flexible sensor based on thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). Initially, the TPU nanofiber membrane was prepared by electrospinning. Subsequently, high-aspect-ratio AgNWs were synthesized via a one-step polyol reduction method. The AgNWs with the optimal aspect ratio were selected for the conductive layer and spray-coated onto the surface of the TPU nanofiber membrane. Another layer of TPU nanofiber membrane was then laminated on top, resulting in a flexible thin-film sensor with a ""sandwich"" structure. Through morphological, chemical structure, and crystallinity analyses, the primary factors influencing AgNWs' growth were investigated. Performance tests revealed that the prepared AgNWs had an average length of approximately 130 μm, a diameter of about 80 nm, and an average aspect ratio exceeding 1500, with the highest being 1921. The obtained sensor exhibited a low initial resistance (26.7 Ω), high strain range (sensing, ε = 0-150%), high sensitivity (GF, over 19.21), fast response and recovery time (112 ms), and excellent conductivity (428 S/cm). Additionally, the sensor maintained stable resistance after 3000 stretching cycles at a strain range of 0-10%.

40871906,Hemodynamic Response Asymmetry During Motor Imagery in Stroke Patients: A Novel NIRS-BCI Assessment Approach.,"Understanding patterns of interhemispheric asymmetry is crucial for monitoring neuroplastic changes during post-stroke motor rehabilitation. However, conventional laterality indices often pose computational challenges when applied to functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data due to the bidirectional hemodynamic responses. In this study, we analyze fNIRS recordings from 15 post-stroke patients undergoing motor imagery brain-computer interface training across multiple sessions. We compare traditional laterality coefficients with a novel task response asymmetry coefficient (TRAC), which quantifies differential hemispheric involvement during motor imagery tasks. Both indices are calculated for oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin responses using general linear model coefficients, and their day-to-day dynamics are assessed with linear regression. The proposed TRAC demonstrates greater sensitivity than conventional measures, revealing significantly higher oxygenated hemoglobin TRAC values (0.18 ± 0.19 vs. -0.05 ± 0.20, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and lower deoxygenated hemoglobin TRAC values (-0.15 ± 0.27 vs. 0.04 ± 0.23, <i>p</i> < 0.05) in lesioned compared to intact hemispheres. Among patients who exhibit substantial motor recovery, distinct daily TRAC dynamics were observed, with statistically significant temporal trends. Overall, the novel TRAC metric offers enhanced discrimination of interhemispheric asymmetry patterns and captures temporal neuroplastic changes not detected by conventional indices, providing a more sensitive biomarker for tracking rehabilitation progress in post-stroke brain-computer interface applications.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025
40867138,Hybrid EEG Feature Learning Method for Cross-Session Human Mental Attention State Classification.,"Decoding mental attention states from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is crucial for numerous applications such as cognitive monitoring, adaptive human-computer interaction, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, conventional EEG-based approaches often focus on channel-wise processing and are limited to intra-session or subject-specific scenarios, lacking robustness in cross-session or inter-subject conditions. In this study, we propose a hybrid feature learning framework for robust classification of mental attention states, including focused, unfocused, and drowsy conditions, across both sessions and individuals. Our method integrates preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification in a unified pipeline. We extract channel-wise spectral features using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and further incorporate both functional and structural connectivity features to capture inter-regional interactions in the brain. A two-stage feature selection strategy, combining correlation-based filtering and random forest ranking, is adopted to enhance feature relevance and reduce dimensionality. Support vector machine (SVM) is employed for final classification due to its efficiency and generalization capability. Experimental results on two cross-session and inter-subject EEG datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves classification accuracy of 86.27% and 94.01%, respectively, significantly outperforming traditional methods. These findings suggest that integrating connectivity-aware features with spectral analysis can enhance the generalizability of attention decoding models. The proposed framework provides a promising foundation for the development of practical EEG-based systems for continuous mental state monitoring and adaptive BCIs in real-world environments.",Brain sciences,2025
40863483,Bangla Speech Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning-Based Ensemble Learning and Feature Fusion.,"Emotion recognition in speech is essential for enhancing human-computer interaction (HCI) systems. Despite progress in Bangla speech emotion recognition, challenges remain, including low accuracy, speaker dependency, and poor generalization across emotional expressions. Previous approaches often rely on traditional machine learning or basic deep learning models, struggling with robustness and accuracy in noisy or varied data. In this study, we propose a novel multi-stream deep learning feature fusion approach for Bangla speech emotion recognition, addressing the limitations of existing methods. Our approach begins with various data augmentation techniques applied to the training dataset, enhancing the model's robustness and generalization. We then extract a comprehensive set of handcrafted features, including Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR), chromagram, spectral centroid, spectral roll-off, spectral contrast, spectral flatness, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Root Mean Square (RMS) energy, and Mel-spectrogram. Although these features are used as 1D numerical vectors, some of them are computed from time-frequency representations (e.g., chromagram, Mel-spectrogram) that can themselves be depicted as images, which is conceptually close to imaging-based analysis. These features capture key characteristics of the speech signal, providing valuable insights into the emotional content. Sequentially, we utilize a multi-stream deep learning architecture to automatically learn complex, hierarchical representations of the speech signal. This architecture consists of three distinct streams: the first stream uses 1D convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs), the second integrates 1D CNN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the third combines 1D CNNs with bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM). These models capture intricate emotional nuances that handcrafted features alone may not fully represent. For each of these models, we generate predicted scores and then employ ensemble learning with a soft voting technique to produce the final prediction. This fusion of handcrafted features, deep learning-derived features, and ensemble voting enhances the accuracy and robustness of emotion identification across multiple datasets. Our method demonstrates the effectiveness of combining various learning models to improve emotion recognition in Bangla speech, providing a more comprehensive solution compared with existing methods. We utilize three primary datasets-SUBESCO, BanglaSER, and a merged version of both-as well as two external datasets, RAVDESS and EMODB, to assess the performance of our models. Our method achieves impressive results with accuracies of 92.90%, 85.20%, 90.63%, 67.71%, and 69.25% for the SUBESCO, BanglaSER, merged SUBESCO and BanglaSER, RAVDESS, and EMODB datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining handcrafted features with deep learning-based features through ensemble learning for robust emotion recognition in Bangla speech.",Journal of imaging,2025
40862868,WGGLFA: Wavelet-Guided Global-Local Feature Aggregation Network for Facial Expression Recognition.,"Facial expression plays an important role in human-computer interaction and affective computing. However, existing expression recognition methods cannot effectively capture multi-scale structural details contained in facial expressions, leading to a decline in recognition accuracy. Inspired by the multi-scale processing mechanism of the biological visual system, this paper proposes a wavelet-guided global-local feature aggregation network (WGGLFA) for facial expression recognition (FER). Our WGGLFA network consists of three main modules: the scale-aware expansion (SAE) module, which combines dilated convolution and wavelet transform to capture multi-scale contextual features; the structured local feature aggregation (SLFA) module based on facial keypoints to extract structured local features; and the expression-guided region refinement (ExGR) module, which enhances features from high-response expression areas to improve the collaborative modeling between local details and key expression regions. All three modules utilize the spatial frequency locality of the wavelet transform to achieve high-/low-frequency feature separation, thereby enhancing fine-grained expression representation under frequency domain guidance. Experimental results show that our WGGLFA achieves accuracies of 90.32%, 91.24%, and 71.90% on the RAF-DB, FERPlus, and FED-RO datasets, respectively, demonstrating that our WGGLFA is effective and has more capability of robustness and generalization than state-of-the-art (SOTA) expression recognition methods.","Biomimetics (Basel, Switzerland)",2025

However, conventional unimodal sensors are limited in their ability to capture multidimensional signals in complex scenarios. To address this issue, this study synthesized a polymerizable deep eutectic solvent (pDES) from choline chloride (Chcl) and acrylic acid (AA). Subsequently, phytic acid (PA), hollow polyaniline microspheres (HPS), and graphene oxide (GO) were incorporated into the pDES, resulting in a composite eutectogel (PAAGH gel) via photoinitiated free radical polymerization. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of multiple hydrogen bonding interactions and a dual conductive network, the PAAGH gel exhibited excellent mechanical properties and electrical conductivity, with a tensile strength of up to 195 kPa, strain at break of 1768 %, conductivity of 0.8 × 10<sup>-2</sup> S/m, and a self-healing efficiency of 94.5 % within 48 h. Notably, its extensive hydrogen bonding network provided robust adhesion to various substrates, including plastics, rubbers, and metals. Furthermore, the integration of the dual conductive network (HPS/GO) into the gels enabled a strain sensitivity of 9.7, a response time to pressure of 46 ms, a wide temperature monitoring range of 0-100 °C, along with long-term stability. Capitalizing on the exceptional sensing characteristics, the assembled sensor array exhibited strong capabilities in human health monitoring, hand motion recognition, and the spatial distribution of temperature and pressure signals. These features collectively open up promising applications for the sensor in areas such as electronic skin and intelligent prosthetics.",Journal of colloid and interface science,2025

This paper reports a multifunctional nanofibrous e-skin (PTZ-PPPB-PPT) fabricated via layer-by-layer electrospinning, integrating a hydrophobic layer (PVDF-TrFE/ZnO), a piezoelectric enhancement layer (PAN/PVP/PDA@BTO), and a thermochromic layer (PAN/PVP/TCM). Benefited from the asymmetric wettability and hierarchical fiber structure, the device enables unidirectional sweat transport (contact angle reduces from 132.8° to 0° within 5.72 s) while blocking reverse osmosis (hydrostatic resistance of 40 mmH₂O). When the piezoelectric sensor operates under excessive sweating conditions, the unidirectional sweat transport maintains skin surface dryness, thereby ensuring stable piezoelectric output during movement. Notably, the E-skin achieves a high output voltage (40 V at 30 N with a sensitivity of 0.825 V/N), exhibits rapid response/recovery (100/80 ms). It also demonstrates reversible thermochromism (25-40 °C) for real-time temperature visualization. Additionally, the device ensures superior comfort during prolonged wear by maintaining exceptional air permeability (8.05 mm/s) and outstanding mechanical flexibility (187.75 % elongation at break). This multifunctional integrated E-skin synergizes sweat management with temperature visualization, holding promising potential for applications in wearable healthcare, human-computer interaction, and dynamic environmental monitoring.",Journal of colloid and interface science,2026
40854103,Gradient Porous Flexible Pressure Sensors with the Relay Effect for High-Accuracy Braille-to-Speech Recognition.,"The development of highly sensitive, wide linear-range flexible pressure sensors is crucial for practical applications in human-computer interaction, physiological signal detection, and motion monitoring. However, traditional flexible pressure sensors often suffer from limited compressibility in their structural design, resulting in rapid saturation of the detection range and low sensitivity, which hinder their commercial viability. In this study, we propose a straightforward electrospinning method to fabricate a thermoplastic polyurethane/carboxyl-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotube/polydimethylsiloxane (TPU/c-MWCNTs/PDMS) piezoresistive sensor featuring a gradient porous structure. Owing to the gradient porous structure and PDMS surface treatment, the device exhibits significantly enhanced sensitivity and an extended linear range. The optimized sensor demonstrates a broad linear detection range of 0-200 kPa, a high sensitivity of 78.41 kPa<sup>-1</sup>, a low detection limit of 8 Pa, a fast response time of 80 ms, and exceptional durability over 10,000 loading/unloading cycles, enabling precise detection of complex human motions. Furthermore, by integrating a deep-learning algorithm, we developed an intelligent Braille-to-speech recognition system capable of accurately translating Braille alphabets and sentences into speech with recognition accuracies of 94.3 and 93.9%, respectively. This innovative structural design not only addresses the trade-off between sensitivity and linear range in flexible pressure sensors but also paves the way for advanced assistive technologies to enhance the quality of life for individuals with disabilities.",ACS sensors,2025

Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was successfully added to a double network composite hydrogel based on polyacrylamide (PAM)/gelatin, resulting in a synergistic improvement in visualization, excellent mechanical properties (stress = 0.458 MPa, strain = 946 %, toughness = 1.97 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>), strong self-adhesion (adhesion strength = 6.21-8.91 kPa), and a broad range of sensitive conductivity (GF = 2.42-7.21, response time = 210 ms). It also demonstrated potential for dynamic anti-counterfeiting. Results showed that adding CMC increased the hydrogel's suitability for visualization and significantly boosted its mechanical properties, enabling it to be both conductive and strain-sensitive. This makes it suitable for monitoring human movements and emotional changes. Additionally, the hydrogel displayed universal self-adhesive properties, allowing it to adhere stably to human skin and accurately track large joint movements and micro-expressions. For further functionality, the hydrogel's transparency was enhanced by ionic crosslinking through immersion in CaCl₂ solution, and its dynamic optical response offers new possibilities for anti-counterfeiting. The combined use of CMC and ion regulation overcomes the usual trade-offs between mechanical strength, conductivity, and visualization in traditional hydrogels. This creates a high-performance material platform for next-generation multifunctional flexible wearable sensors and paves the way for advances in human-computer interaction, flexible electronic skin, and visual sensors.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2025
40843108,Motor imagery EEG classification method using 3D CNN and LSTM for rehabilitation application.,"Due to the limitations in the accuracy and robustness of current EEG classification methods, applying motor imagery for practical Brain-Computer Interface applications remains challenging. Therefore, an EEG classification method with high accuracy and strong robustness is of significant importance. This paper proposed a method called 3D CNN and LSTM for Motor Imagery (3D-CLMI), which combines 3D CNN and LSTM network with attention to classify MI-EEG signals. This method combined MI-EEG signals from different channels into 3D features and extracted spatial features through convolution operations with multiple 3D convolutional kernels of different scales. At the same time, in order to ensure the integrity of the extracted temporal features of the MI-EEG signal, 3D-CLMI adopted a parallel structure to obtain spatial and temporal features respectively, and then combined the obtained features for classification. Experimental results showed that this method achieved a classification accuracy of 92.7% and an F1-score of 0.91 on BCI Competition IV 2a, which were both higher than the state-of-the-art methods in the field of MI tasks. Additionally, 12 participants were invited to complete a four-class MI task, and experiments on the collected dataset showed that our method also maintained the highest classification accuracy and F1-score. Our proposed method achieved the best results on both datasets, and we then demonstrated the effectiveness of each part of the proposed method through ablation experiments. Additionally, we designed a rehabilitation application system in a VR environment based on the proposed method, and the experimental results validated that it could assist patients with impaired hand motor function.",Cognitive neurodynamics,2025

Technology-driven virtual coaches have the potential to enhance and improve exercise programs, but the preferences of the aging population were not previously explored. This study examined and analyzed the attributes and levels related to the acceptance of virtual coaches among the aging cohort via experience-based conjoint and latent class analysis. Purposively selected respondents (<i>n</i> = 232) from two senior centers in the Philippines completed a conjoint activity followed by a computer-based survey focusing on attributes related to platform, appearance, gender, language, and music. Results revealed the subjects' inclination to a humanlike, feminine, local language-speaking virtual coach projected through a mixed reality platform with a contemporary music background.

40840869,Personalization of AI Using Personal Foundation Models Can Lead to More Precise Digital Therapeutics.,"Digital health interventions often use machine learning (ML) models to make predictions of repeated adverse health events. For example, models may be used to analyze patient data to identify patterns that can anticipate the likelihood of disease exacerbations, enabling timely interventions and personalized treatment plans. However, many digital health applications require the prediction of highly heterogeneous and nuanced health events. The cross-subject variability of these events makes traditional ML approaches, where a single generalized model is trained to classify a particular condition, unlikely to generalize to patients outside of the training set. A natural solution is to train a separate model for each individual or subgroup, essentially overfitting the model to the unique characteristics of the individual without negatively overfitting in terms of the desired prediction task. Such an approach has traditionally required extensive data labels from each individual, a reality that has rendered personalized ML infeasible for precision health care. The recent popularization of self-supervised learning, however, provides a solution to this issue: by pretraining deep learning models on the vast array of unlabeled data streams arising from patient-generated health data, personalized models can be fine-tuned to predict the health outcome of interest with fewer labels than purely supervised approaches, making personalization of deep learning models much more achievable from a practical perspective. This perspective describes the current state-of-the-art in both self-supervised learning and ML personalization for health care as well as growing efforts to combine these two ideas by conducting self-supervised pretraining on an individual's data. However, there are practical challenges that must be addressed in order to fully realize this potential, such as human-computer interaction innovations to ensure consistent labeling practices within a single participant.",JMIR AI,2025

This research examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) can transform the accessibility of ML technologies within organizations through a human-centered Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) approach. Through a comprehensive user study involving 15 professionals across various roles and technical backgrounds, we evaluate the organizational impact of an LLM-based AutoML framework compared to traditional implementation methods. Our research offers four significant contributions to both management practice and technical innovation: First, we present pioneering evidence that LLM-based interfaces can dramatically improve ML implementation success rates, with 93.34% of users achieved superior performance in the LLM condition, with 46.67% showing higher accuracy (10%-25% improvement over baseline) and 46.67% demonstrating significantly higher accuracy (>25% improvement over baseline), while 6.67% maintained comparable performance levels; and 60% reporting substantially reduced development time. Second, we demonstrate how natural language interfaces can effectively bridge the technical skills gap in organizations, cutting implementation time by 50% while improving accuracy across all expertise levels. Third, we provide valuable insights for organizations designing human-AI collaborative systems, showing that our approach reduced error resolution time by 73% and significantly accelerated employee learning curves. Finally, we establish empirical support for natural language as an effective interface for complex technical systems, offering organizations a path to democratize ML capabilities without compromising quality or performance.",Frontiers in artificial intelligence,2025
40837875,Generative Artificial Intelligence in the Metaverse Era: A Review on Models and Applications.,"The Metaverse is a decentralized, immersive 3-dimensional virtual environment that merges the physical and virtual worlds, fundamentally transforming digital interaction and garnering widespread attention. However, its primary platforms face challenges such as low-quality content and underdeveloped virtual environments, leading to a subpar user experience. Artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) has emerged as a key driver in Metaverse development, enabling the efficient and cost-effective creation of digital content. AIGC also promotes personalized content, further enhancing the appeal of the Metaverse. Although AIGC holds great promise, comprehensive investigations into its underlying models and applications remain limited. This study begins with the core neural network architectures of generative AI and examines the relationship between the Metaverse and AIGC. It delves into the deep learning technologies that support AIGC, providing both qualitative and quantitative analyses of their advantages, limitations, and hardware constraints. We also review existing practical applications of the Metaverse, highlighting the challenges and future opportunities in key domains such as healthcare and education. The research concludes that while AIGC can markedly accelerate the development of the Metaverse, its technology must be more closely aligned with development needs to deliver a truly immersive experience. The integration of AIGC and the Metaverse represents the convergence of artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction. This interdisciplinary synergy has the potential to redefine the way we create, interact with, and experience digital environments, pushing the boundaries of creativity and immersion.","Research (Washington, D.C.)",2025
40836237,Technostress among nurses: boon or bane? The moderated mediation model.,"Today, increasing digitalization and intensified human-computer interaction in healthcare services have significantly changed nurses’ daily work processes. This situation has caused the emergence of a type of stress called technostress among nurses. The negative outcomes of technostress, generally referred to as its dark side, have been frequently emphasized in the literature. On the other hand, studies on the bright side of technostress, that is, its positive outcomes, are quite limited. Based on the job demands-resources model, this study assumes that technostress creators may have negative and positive outcomes. In this context, this study aims to examine the indirect effects of technostress creators on job satisfaction through techno-eustress, on burnout through techno-distress, and how these indirect effects change depending on technical support and technology competence. This study adopted a quantitative, correlational design and was conducted using a cross-sectional survey. Data were collected at a single time point from a convenience sample of nurses working in one hospital. The proposed research model was empirically tested using path analysis. Findings show that technostress creators increase burnout through techno-distress and job satisfaction through techno-eustress. It also shows that these indirect effects vary depending on the technology competence levels of nurses, and as the technology competence level increases, the indirect effects weaken. In conclusion, the research findings revealed that, unlike other studies in the literature, technostress creators cannot be described as just a boon or a bane but can produce positive or negative outcomes through various mechanisms.",BMC nursing,2025
40834554,Mixed reality in orthopaedics: A systematic review and meta-analysis on clinical and technological aspects.,"This article presents a systematic review of mixed reality (MR)-based tools in orthopaedics, motivated by their growing clinical relevance and the lack of existing reviews that comprehensively assess both clinical outcomes and technical implementations. A literature search was conducted in October 2024, covering Scopus, IEEE, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline in EBSCO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases, yielding 48 eligible studies. Data on clinical and technological aspects were extracted, including clinical applications, clinical and procedural outcomes, hardware, registration, tracking, and evaluation metrics. MR-based tools led to better clinical and procedural outcomes compared to traditional procedures, including reduced intraoperative time and radiation exposure, safer and less invasive interventions, and fewer postoperative complications. Surgical navigation was the most employed application, especially in spinal and joint procedures, likely due to their complexity and demand for high precision. Most procedures did not require intraoperative imaging, reflecting a shift towards radiation-free workflows enabled by MR guidance. Visualisations typically involved holographic surgical plans rendered through head-mounted displays, primary devices for registration and tracking, often using manual techniques with limited accuracy. Despite their promise, several limitations hinder MR's broader adoption. Studies often lack high-level clinical evidence, standardised evaluation protocols, and robust registration and tracking methods, due to user dependency and system instability. Future studies should include control groups and report clinical and procedural outcomes to facilitate clinical translation. There is also space to explore new automated, non-invasive registration strategies and hybrid tracking solutions to mitigate occlusion, enhance alignment stability, and improve procedural reliability.",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,2025
40831474,Predicting emotional responses in interactive art using Random Forests: a model grounded in enactive aesthetics.,"Interactive installation art offers immersive and participatory environments that elicit complex and multidimensional emotional experiences-encompassing sensorimotor engagement, affective resonance, and cognitive reflection. However, these emotional responses' inherently dynamic, subjective, and often pre-reflective nature poses significant challenges to their systematic prediction and computational modeling. To address these challenges, the present study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework grounded in the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, which provides a balanced trade-off between predictive performance and model transparency, thereby aligning with the needs of theory-driven emotion research. Based on 390 valid questionnaire responses, emotional responses were operationalized along five distinct dimensions: bodily changes, sensory engagement, emotional connection, cognitive reflection, and active personalization. Predictor variables encompassed sensory stimuli, multimodal interactional features, and immersive environmental cues. Model evaluation was conducted using cross-validation and held-out test sets, applying classification and regression metrics to assess performance. The RF model demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy in the domains of cognitive reflection (F1 = 0.746, accuracy = 0.769) and active personalization (F1 = 0.673, accuracy = 0.705), suggesting that these cognitively mediated responses exhibit greater consistency and learnability across participants. In contrast, bodily responses proved substantially less predictable (F1 = 0.379, accuracy = 0.397), likely due to their idiosyncratic, embodied, and non-verbal nature, which may not be adequately captured by self-report measures alone. These differential results underscore the relative tractability of modeling reflective and agentic emotional states in contrast to those rooted in sensorimotor or affective processes. Moreover, the model's consistent performance across all evaluation phases affirms its suitability as an exploratory tool for investigating emotion in interactive art contexts. This study contributes to the evolving convergence of affective computing, human-computer interaction (HCI), and empirical aesthetics. The proposed framework yields actionable insights for the design of emotionally adaptive systems. Future research should consider the integration of multimodal and temporally granular data, and the ethical dimensions associated with affective adaptivity in artistic and public-facing environments.",Frontiers in psychology,2025

40820507,Evaluating the Efficacy of ChatGPT-3.5 Versus Human-Delivered Text-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: A Comparative Pilot Study.,"The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI) therapist (ChatGPT-3.5) and a human therapist in delivering text-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS) scores and qualitative responses from participants were used to assess ChatGPT-3.5's capabilities within the limitations of this deployment. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 208 mental health professionals and trainees, 75 of whom completed the study. Participants assessed two text-based CBT transcripts (AI therapist and human therapist) using the CTRS and provided qualitative feedback. Both the AI therapist and the human therapist were presented with identical clinical scenarios to ensure consistency. The human therapist outperformed ChatGPT-3.5 across most CTRS domains (α=0.001). More than half (52%) of the respondents rated the human therapist's agenda setting highest, with a score of 6, compared with 28% who gave this rating to ChatGPT-3.5. In elicited feedback, 29% rated the human therapist as highly effective (score=6), whereas only 9% rated ChatGPT-3.5 similarly (p<0.001). The human therapist also scored higher on guided discovery (24% vs. 12%, p<0.001). ChatGPT-3.5 was rated similarly to the human therapist in understanding the patient's internal reality (36% vs. 19%, p=0.004) but was often seen as less personalized and more rigid. The findings suggest that although ChatGPT-3.5 may complement human-based therapy, this specific implementation of AI lacked the depth required for stand-alone use. These findings, however, cannot be generalized to all AI-based therapy because the study did not account for the diverse ways therapy can be delivered.",American journal of psychotherapy,2025

However, existing approaches face challenges like computational complexity and class imbalance, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. While transformer-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their size and latency hinder real-time applications. To address these issues, we propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that transfers knowledge from a fine-tuned BERT-base teacher model to lightweight DistilBERT and ALBERT student models, optimised for efficient emotion recognition. Our approach integrates a hybrid loss function combining focal loss and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to enhance minority class recognition, attention-head alignment for effective contextual knowledge transfer, and semantic-preserving data augmentation to mitigate class imbalance. Experiments on two datasets, Twitter Emotions 416 K samples, six classes, and Social Media Emotion 75 K samples, five classes, show that our distilled models achieve near-teacher performance 97.35% and 73.86% accuracy, respectively. with only a < 1% and < 6% accuracy drop, while reducing model size by 40% and inference latency by 3.2×.

This critique underscores the need for advanced methodologies, capable of navigating these challenges to enhance the accuracy and reliability of cognitive task-related EEG studies. This study addresses the challenge of accurately detecting cognitive states using EEG signals. This helps in overcoming the challenges by high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and noise in raw EEG data. Traditional classifiers such as SVMs and ANNs often fail to fully exploit the temporal and frequency features present in EEG. In order to overcome these limitations, this work introduces a novel Deep Forest-based classification model. This model is optimised through XGBoost for feature selection. A self-acquired dataset using the g.Nautilus EEG device from 12 student volunteers performing cognitive tasks forms the basis of the evaluation. A total of 48 features, spanning time, frequency, entropy, and autoregressive domains, are extracted. The proposed model achieves high classification accuracy (99.692%) while reducing computational time.

Investigating the Cognitive Plausibility of Language and Vision Models via Eye-Tracking in Human-Robot Interaction.,"As large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) become increasingly used in robotics area, a crucial question arises: to what extent do these models replicate human-like cognitive processes, particularly within socially interactive contexts? Whilst these models demonstrate impressive multimodal reasoning and perception capabilities, their cognitive plausibility remains underexplored. In this study, we address this gap by using human visual attention as a behavioural proxy for cognition in a naturalistic human-robot interaction (HRI) scenario. Eye-tracking data were previously collected from participants engaging in social human-human interactions, providing frame-level gaze fixations as a human attentional ground truth. We then prompted a state-of-the-art VLM (LLaVA) to generate scene descriptions, which were processed by four LLMs (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, Qwen1.5-7B-Chat, LLaMA-3.1-8b-instruct, and Gemma-7b-it) to infer saliency points. Critically, we evaluated each model in both stateless and memory-augmented (short-term memory, STM) modes to assess the influence of temporal context on saliency prediction. Our results presented that whilst stateless LLaVA most closely replicates human gaze patterns, STM confers measurable benefits only for DeepSeek, whose lexical anchoring mirrors human rehearsal mechanisms. Other models exhibited degraded performance with memory due to prompt interference or limited contextual integration. This work introduces a novel, empirically grounded framework for assessing cognitive plausibility in generative models and underscores the role of short-term memory in shaping human-like visual attention in robotic systems.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025

40789045,Demethylated Lignin@Liquid Metal Nanospheres Enabling Versatile Conductive Hydrogel for Self-Powered Soft Electronics.,"Conductive hydrogels have become highly attractive in smart, soft electronics. However, it remains a substantial challenge to employ a low-cost and fast gelation technique to proceed with the effective function integration of conductive hydrogels with superior mechanical robustness, high adhesiveness, and impressive self-healable properties. Herein, a versatile biomass-based hydrogel (DLLMH) was synthesized with built-in demethylated lignin (DL) coated liquid metal (LM) (DL@LM) nanospheres to promote polymerization, yielding excellent mechanical (3.77 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>), exceptional conductivity (2.14 mS/cm), outstanding adhesion (36.47 MPa), and desired self-healing ability. Notably, the LM could significantly accelerate the initiation of free-radical polymerization (280 s) without heating and UV irradiation, while DL acts as a stabilizing agent to prevent hydrogel overpolymerization and inhibit the occurrence of LM precipitation. Meanwhile, the assembled DL@LM also aimed at isotropic extension deformation and multiple interactions within the DLLMH matrix, which greatly conferred its efficient energy dissipation. Considering extraordinary flexibility and conductivity, DLLMH could be assembled as the multimodular sensing paradigm toward strain and temperature. As-a-proof-of-concept, a single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) was constructed for self-powered mechanical energy harvesting and conversion and served as touch panels of the TENG array in a self-powered calculator for applications of human-computer interaction. This work will enrich the exploration of green chemistry and value-added utilization of lignin, providing a sustainable avenue for the untapped potential in design and application of hydrogel-based soft electronics.",ACS nano,2025

40780068,Sentence-resampled BERT-CRF model for autonomous vehicle crash causality analysis from large-scale accident narrative text data.,"As autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been increasingly used, exploring crash causality mechanisms is critical to improving traffic safety related to AVs use. However, existing studies have primarily employed structured data to analyze such causality, while limited efforts have been made to identify causality from unstructured crash narratives, which are featured by data imbalance and small sample sizes. Original crash narratives contain a wealth of latent information about AV crashes that can further the understanding of AV safety. This study proposes a Sentence-resampled BERT-CRF model combined with a DREAM-inspired hierarchical causal attribution framework to systematically analyze the causality mechanisms of AV crashes based on original crash narratives. First, an annotation scheme combining ""BIO"" and ""C-P-R-D"" tags is designed to capture temporal causal relationships in crash narratives and extract causal movement chain (CMC) by the BERT-CRF model. Meanwhile, the data imbalance problem is mitigated by using the sentence-level resampling method, and the results show that the model is 98.03% accurate on the complete dataset, and maintains 96.14% accuracy with a small sample of 10%. Then, a two-tier causal attribution framework(5 categories and 52 elements) inspired by DREAM theory is developed to identify 16 categories of typical scenarios, with rear-end(48.57%) and lane-change (17.04%) collisions as high-risk scenarios. In-depth analysis shows that rear-end crashes are mostly caused by the coupling of a conventional vehicle (CV) following too close to the AV(B5) and the AV's insufficient decisive decision to slow down (A2), while lane-change crashes are associated with the CV's hazardous lane-change (B2) and the delay of AV's intent recognition. The proposed framework bridges the gap between unstructured narratives data and structured causal inference, revealing human-computer interaction deficiencies, environment perception limitations, and roadway facility impacts as the core causal factors. These findings provide data-driven theoretical support for AV manufacturers to optimize sensing algorithms and traffic authorities to develop corresponding regulations.",Accident; analysis and prevention,2025

40773414,Simultaneous Estimation of Wrist Joint Angle and Torque During Isokinetic Contraction Based on HD-sEMG.,"The establishment of a natural and smooth human-computer interface is crucial for myoelectric control, which requires an effective decoding method for movement intention. Based on high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG), this study explored a method to simultaneously estimate wrist joint angle and torque during isokinetic contraction. Ten able-bodied individuals were instructed to complete wrist isokinetic flexion and extension tasks with different movement patterns, and the HD-sEMG signals were collected. To decode these signals, a convolutional neural network (CNN) incorporating the global attention mechanism was established, named global attention convolutional neural network (GACNN). Six other decoding models were also used to continuously estimate the wrist joint angle and torque, including support vector machine (SVM), residual network (ResNet), long short-term memory (LSTM), transformer-based model (TBM), muscle synergy-based graph attention networks (MSGAT-LSTM), and spatio-temporal feature extraction network (STFEN). Evaluation metrics including normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) were applied to evaluate the estimation performance of the seven models. The GACNN showed significantly better estimation performance than SVM, LSTM, ResNet, STFEN and it also demonstrated superior performance over TBM and MSGAT-LSTM in some estimation cases. On average, for all subjects, NRMSE and PCC of the GACNN were $0.080~\pm ~0.013$ and $0.955~\pm ~0.016$ . The result shows the superiority of the neural network incorporating global attention mechanism, which is of great significance for the application of human-computer interaction.",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2025
40771955,Horse owners seeking online health information: a mixed-methods study.,"Many people seek health-related information online, not only for themselves but also on behalf of others who cannot articulate their symptoms. This proxy information-seeking behavior is particularly relevant for animal owners, who must interpret their animals' symptoms without direct verbal feedback. While online health information-seeking in the context of one's own health is well-studied, the specific challenges of searching by proxy, especially for animal health information, remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to determine the specific information needs and search behavior of animal owners. As a case study, horse owners were selected, representing a group regularly searching the web for health-related advice concerning their animals. A mixed-methods approach was used with 17 horse owners in Germany. Participants first described a recent search for equine health information. They were then shown a video of a horse experiencing an asthma attack and asked to conduct a search on how to proceed with the horse's condition. Afterwards, they were questioned about their respective search behavior. The participants' main initial questions revolved around the cause of the horse's condition, its urgency of veterinary treatment and the cost of treatment. All participants chose the Google search engine as the starting point for their search and formulated an average of 3.71 (SD: 2.02) queries. Each of these queries contained an average of 3.81 words (SD: 1.57). Most searches (52%) were evidence-directed with 29% using multiple descriptors of the horse's situation. An average of 0.97 results (SD: 1.38) were clicked per query, with titles containing all search terms in 13% of cases. Participants reported experiencing several barriers to their search, including difficulties in formulating precise queries and the need for additional guidance during the search process. The findings highlight the need for improved online information systems, offering better guidance, context-aware search support, and trustworthy sources. The insights could inform veterinarians on how to better address their clients' communication and information needs, provide them with the skills and knowledge they need to conduct online research and therefore build a better animal health partnership with them.",Frontiers in veterinary science,2025

40751820,Understanding Clinician Perceptions of GenAI: A Mixed Methods Analysis of Clinical Documentation Tasks.,"This mixed-methods study evaluated clinicians' user experience (UX) with Generative AI (GenAI) in Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems across three clinical documentation tasks (Information Extraction, Summarization, and Speech-to-Text) at varying levels of user supervision (low, medium, high), focusing on workflow improvements, safety, and acceptable automation levels. Using conceptual prototyping in a usability study framework, we evaluated how incorporating GenAI into EHR could support the three documentation tasks at varying automation levels. A total of 38 clinicians interacted with the prototype and completed a questionnaire on task relevance, perceived importance, desired automation level, and EHR satisfaction. Both quantitative (descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis tests, Spearman correlations) and qualitative (thematic) analyses were conducted with equal priority to explore preferences, perceived safety, and practical requirements. Clinicians showed positive reception to GenAI integration, particularly for streamlining documentation. While task relevance and importance were strongly correlated, EHR satisfaction did not significantly predict automation acceptance. Medium automation emerged as the preferred level, considered ""safe with caution"". Five key themes emerged from qualitative analysis: efficiency and quality benefits; system reliability concerns; safety and medico-legal considerations; automation bias and loss of nuance; and deployment requirements including adjustable settings and oversight. While clinicians welcome GenAI-driven documentation, they prefer moderate automation to balance efficiency with clinical control. Successful integration requires addressing safety concerns, conducting real-world trials, and mitigating potential biases and medico-legal challenges. These findings suggest a cautious but optimistic path forward for AI integration in EHR systems, emphasizing the importance of maintaining clinician oversight while leveraging automation benefits.",Journal of medical systems,2025
40748805,A Causal Learning-Based sEMG Disentanglement Framework for Multi-Posture Domain Generalization.,"Surface electromyography (sEMG) -based human-computer interaction (HCI) systems achieve high accuracy in controlled environments, but their robustness under daily life remains challenging. In real-world scenarios, variations in user posture introduce personalized biases that can significantly degrade model performance. A viable solution is to train a highly generalized network using existing data from various postures, enabling the model to become less sensitive to posture variations. In this work, we treat the original sEMG signals as a coupling of pattern and posture components, where each component can be considered as a causal signal specific to corresponding labels. We use the causal encoders to understand the generative relationships between data and labels, facilitating the disentanglement of components into different latent spaces and promoting clustering within each space. This enables the model to extract posture-invariant pattern components and train a robust pattern recognition model with strong generalization capabilities. We developed a high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) dataset with 16 subjects performing in four common HCI postures, addressing the lack of posture variation samples in existing sEMG datasets. Our model achieved an average accuracy of 90.3% across four generalization tasks, outperforming other domain generalization models and demonstrating its superiority.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2025

However, conventional flexible sensors have a single signal response and are susceptible to mechanical damage, thus limiting their potential applications. Here, a self-powered flexible sensor using a cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer (CLCE)-based sandwiched architecture with mechanochromism and triboelectric response is developed. The sensor is constructed by laminating poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) from two sides to the middle CLCE layer, and a thin silver nanowire (AgNWs) is adhesive to the bottom PDMS layer used as a conductor. Specifically, the dynamic covalent bonds endow PDMS and CLCE layers with excellent self-healing performance, and the CLCE layer has a stable mechanochromism characteristic due to the variations of the helical structure upon mechanical forces. The consequent sandwiched-structure sensor has a fast electric response to the applied pressure with a response time of 139 ms and excellent cyclic response stability, which allows for monitoring human motion, as a self-powered wearable sensor.

Earphones have the potential to naturally capture brain activity and its lateralization, which is associated with emotion. In this study, we newly introduced tympanic membrane temperature (TMT), previously used as an index of lateralized brain activation, for earphone-based emotion recognition. We developed custom earphones to measure bilateral TMT and conducted two experiments consisting of emotion induction by autobiographical recall and scenario imagination. Using features derived from the right-left TMT difference, we trained classifiers for both four-class discrete emotion and valence (positive vs. negative) classification tasks.

40729974,Systematically modeling take-over performance: Considering the indirect effect of meteorological visibility mediated by drivers' attention.,"Drivers' take-over performance in conditionally automated driving is simultaneously affected by multiple factors, making the involved causal relationships complex. Although existing studies have explored the mechanism, there is still a lack of models for comprehensively analyzing drivers' take-over performance under diverse meteorological visibility and take-over time budget (TB) conditions. This study established a structural equation model to systematically investigate the complicated causal relationships among TB, meteorological visibility, drivers' attention, and take-over performance. Based on a driving simulation experiment, we developed a measurement model of drivers' attention and take-over performance via confirmatory factor analysis. We deconstructed take-over performance into three aspects: reaction time, control instability, and safety margin. Subsequently, we revealed the causal relationships among the above factors by using path analysis. Our results demonstrated the significant total effects of meteorological visibility on reaction time and safety margin, where the indirect effects are mediated by drivers' attention. However, we found that meteorological visibility barely impacts the control instability aspect of take-over performance. Moreover, the direct effects of TB and drivers' attention on take-over performance were substantial. This study reveals the complex mechanism of take-over performance under diverse conditions and provides a theoretical basis for enhancing the safety and user experience of conditionally automated vehicles.",Accident; analysis and prevention,2025

40723693,The Influence of Spatial Distance and Trade-Off Salience on Ethical Decision-Making: An Eye-Tracking Study Based on Embodied Cognition.,"Research based on the theory of embodied cognition has revealed that the vertical position of target information in space influences individuals' construal level, which in turn affects their ethical decision-making. However, previous studies have shown inconsistent effects of construal level on ethical decision-making, which may be moderated by factors such as the manipulation methods of construal level and the salience of trade-offs. This study examines how manipulating the vertical position (high/low) of target information in space-thereby altering perceived spatial distance-impacts ethical decision-making through the lens of embodied cognition, using eye-tracking technology. Experiment 1 isolated the effect of target verticality, while Experiment 2 introduced trade-off salience as an additional factor. Eye-tracking metrics in Experiment 1 revealed that lower target positions significantly increased late-stage cognitive processing difficulty. Experiment 2 demonstrated an interaction between target position and trade-off salience in ethical decision-making. These findings suggest that spatial positioning influences cognitive processing via construal level, with its effects on ethical decision-making moderated by trade-off cues. In summary, this study reveals the significant influence of trade-off salience as a contextual cue in individuals' ethical decision-making while also providing an embodied cognition perspective to inform decision behavior in human-computer interaction contexts.","Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2025
40718503,An evidence-based digital prescription opioid safety toolkit for national dissemination: co-design and user testing.,"Australia has one of the highest rates of opioid prescribing and prescription opioid-related harm in the world. Although effective for pain relief, the use of prescription opioids is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality. Barriers exist for consumers identifying their own risk factors, accessing naloxone (opioid overdose antidote) and overdose prevention education. This study aimed to co-design a digital Opioid Safety Toolkit for national dissemination through pharmacies to encourage three consumer opioid safety behaviours: (1) uptake of naloxone, (2) creating a safety plan, and (3) discussing their use of opioids, including any concerns with their healthcare professional. The digital Toolkit was co-designed and developed using a novel approach to digital health intervention design combining the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and Double-Diamond design process. Co-design involved a series of seven iterative workshops with consumers (4) and professionals (3). Workshops focused on identifying factors influencing opioid safety behaviours, exploring design preferences, sense-checking, and ideation of the user flow. User testing was conducted with the penultimate version of the Toolkit. 13 consumers with lived experience of prescription opioid use and 14 professionals including prescribers, pharmacists, pain specialists, researchers and consumer advocates participated in up to three separate workshops. 15 consumers participated in user testing interviews. Analysis of workshops identified factors promoting safety behaviours including increased public awareness of naloxone, understanding personal risk (TDF domain of Knowledge); healthcare professional's role in education and consumers' experience of stigma (Social/professional role and identity); use of conversational aids to scaffold conversations, material resources and data ownership (Environment, context and resources). User testing elicited feedback pertaining to the information and resources on the website and the overall user interface and experience. The Toolkit was co-designed with consumers and professionals to facilitate opioid safety behaviours. The Toolkit includes evidence-based information, tools for risk assessment and screening, opioid use monitoring, conversation aids, and a safety plan.

However, its inherent tendency to self-stack limits the tunability of its interlayer structure, which is critical for resistance-based sensing mechanisms. In this work, we successfully achieved continuous tuning of MXene's interlayer spacing, effectively enhancing the sensitivity and overall performance of the pressure sensor. The optimized sensor exhibited outstanding linear sensitivities of 145.5 kPa<sup>-1</sup> in the low-pressure range (0-18 kPa) and 25.7 kPa<sup>-1</sup> in the medium range (18-50 kPa), along with fast response and recovery times of 68 and 40 ms. Furthermore, it demonstrated excellent durability with stable performance over 10,000 loading/unloading cycles.

40717558,What Drives Patient Preferences for AI Chatbots Over Doctors? A Survey Study Using the O-S-O-R Model.,"The increasing prevalence of AI chatbots in healthcare has revolutionized patient care by enhancing accessibility and efficiency while raising critical ethical and privacy concerns. Drawn from the O-S-O-R model, this study utilizes survey data to reveal the complex underlying mechanism from perceived health stigma (O1) to the preference for AI chatbots over doctors (R). Specifically, we theorized the mediating roles of self-disclosure to AI chatbots (S), emotional efficacy, AI privacy concern, and trust in AI chatbots (O2). Structural equation modeling results showed that perceived health stigma significantly motivated individuals to self-disclose to AI chatbots. Self-disclosure enhanced emotional self-efficacy and heightened AI privacy concerns, which respectively facilitated and undermined trust in AI chatbots; trust, in turn, positively influenced a preference for chatbots over doctors. This study extends the O-S-O-R model to human-computer interaction, elucidating how perceived health stigma influences preferences for AI chatbots over doctors.",Health communication,2025
40710627,A Self-Supervised Adversarial Deblurring Face Recognition Network for Edge Devices.,"With the advancement of information technology, human activity recognition (HAR) has been widely applied in fields such as intelligent surveillance, health monitoring, and human-computer interaction. As a crucial component of HAR, facial recognition plays a key role, especially in vision-based activity recognition. However, current facial recognition models on the market perform poorly in handling blurry images and dynamic scenarios, limiting their effectiveness in real-world HAR applications. This study aims to construct a fast and accurate facial recognition model based on novel adversarial learning and deblurring theory to enhance its performance in human activity recognition. The model employs a generative adversarial network (GAN) as the core algorithm, optimizing its generation and recognition modules by decomposing the global loss function and incorporating a feature pyramid, thereby solving the balance challenge in GAN training. Additionally, deblurring techniques are introduced to improve the model's ability to handle blurry and dynamic images. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves high accuracy and recall rates across multiple facial recognition datasets, with an average recall rate of 87.40% and accuracy rates of 81.06% and 79.77% on the YTF, IMDB-WIKI, and WiderFace datasets, respectively. These findings confirm that the model effectively addresses the challenges of recognizing faces in dynamic and blurry conditions in human activity recognition, demonstrating significant application potential.",Journal of imaging,2025
40710227,Adaptive Graph Learning with Multimodal Fusion for Emotion Recognition in Conversation.,"Robust emotion recognition is a prerequisite for natural, fluid human-computer interaction, yet conversational settings remain challenging because emotions are shaped simultaneously by global topic flow and local speaker-to-speaker dependencies. Here, we introduce GASMER-Graph-Adaptive Structure for Multimodal Emotion Recognition-a unified architecture that tackles both issues. It uses the correlation structure based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the complex dependencies in the conversation, while adaptively learning the graph structure for GNNs. The experiments indicate that our model has strong performance that outperforms all existing graph-based approaches, and remains competitive when compared to recent multimodal fusion models, underscoring the importance of combining fine-grained multimodal fusion with adaptive graph learning for conversational emotion recognition.

40708800,GMM-HMM-Based Eye Movement Classification for Efficient and Intuitive Dynamic Human-Computer Interaction Systems.,"Human-computer interaction (HCI) plays a crucial role across various fields, with eye-tracking technology emerging as a key enabler for intuitive and dynamic control in assistive systems like Assistive Robotic Arms (ARAs). By precisely tracking eye movements, this technology allows for more natural user interaction. However, current systems primarily rely on the single gaze-dependent interaction method, which leads to the ""Midas Touch"" problem. This highlights the need for real-time eye movement classification in dynamic interactions to ensure accurate and efficient control. This paper proposes a novel Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden Markov Model (GMM-HMM) classification algorithm aimed at overcoming the limitations of traditional methods in dynamic human-robot interactions. By incorporating sum of squared error (SSE)-based feature extraction and hierarchical training, the proposed algorithm achieves a classification accuracy of 94.39%, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, it is integrated with a robotic arm system, enabling gaze trajectory-based dynamic path planning, which reduces the average path planning time to 2.97 milliseconds. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, offering an efficient and intuitive solution for human-robot interaction in dynamic environments.

40702190,A generic non-invasive neuromotor interface for human-computer interaction.,"Since the advent of computing, humans have sought computer input technologies that are expressive, intuitive and universal. While diverse modalities have been developed, including keyboards, mice and touchscreens, they require interaction with a device that can be limiting, especially in on-the-go scenarios. Gesture-based systems use cameras or inertial sensors to avoid an intermediary device, but tend to perform well only for unobscured movements. By contrast, brain-computer or neuromotor interfaces that directly interface with the body's electrical signalling have been imagined to solve the interface problem<sup>1</sup>, but high-bandwidth communication has been demonstrated only using invasive interfaces with bespoke decoders designed for single individuals<sup>2-4</sup>. Here, we describe the development of a generic non-invasive neuromotor interface that enables computer input decoded from surface electromyography (sEMG). We developed a highly sensitive, easily donned sEMG wristband and a scalable infrastructure for collecting training data from thousands of consenting participants. Together, these data enabled us to develop generic sEMG decoding models that generalize across people. Test users demonstrate a closed-loop median performance of gesture decoding of 0.66 target acquisitions per second in a continuous navigation task, 0.88 gesture detections per second in a discrete-gesture task and handwriting at 20.9 words per minute. We demonstrate that the decoding performance of handwriting models can be further improved by 16% by personalizing sEMG decoding models. To our knowledge, this is the first high-bandwidth neuromotor interface with performant out-of-the-box generalization across people.",Nature,2025

However, optimal interaction between users and these systems remains a challenge. The field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) offers theoretical frameworks to guide the design and evaluation of these technologies, enhancing usability and adoption by health professionals and patients. This systematic review aims to identify and synthesize the most frequently applied HCI theories in health informatics and examine their relevance across digital health technologies. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Three databases-PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar-were searched with no date restriction. Studies were included if they applied a defined HCI theory to the context of health information technologies and were published in English. Review articles, conceptual papers, and studies without a clear theoretical framework were excluded. A total of 67 eligible studies were included in the final synthesis. The use of HCI theories in health information technology has increased notably since 2015, with a sharp rise observed after 2020. The most frequently used frameworks included the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). mHealth applications accounted for most theory applications (37%), followed by hospital information systems and web-based tools. The geographic distribution revealed that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia produced the highest number of theory-driven studies. HCI theories are vital in improving the design, usability, and implementation of health information systems. This review underscores the importance of integrating user-centered theoretical frameworks in system development and calls for broader geographic and contextual diversity in future theory-based research.",Health science reports,2025
40696905,Influence factors and improving strategies of perceived safety - an on-road study with L2 autonomous driving.,"Perceived safety (PS) and trust are important factors that influence the adoption of autonomous driving. In order to study the factors influencing PS and the possibility of real-time monitoring, an on-road experiment with L2 autonomous driving with 30 participants was conducted. Participants experienced autonomous driving functions as co-drivers and rated PS through video replays. Physiological data were recorded during the experiment and analysed afterwards. It was found that PS significantly reduced during events of hard braking and bumps, whereas it was high during congestions and hard-turning events when speed was relatively lower. Analysis of geolocations and environmental data around the vehicle showed that tunnels, terrain and traffic complexity would impact PS. Physiological data showed a significant negative correlation between electromyogram (EMG) of the lower limb and PS. Through post-experiment interviews, technical and human-computer interaction (HCI) measures that are expected to improve PS are proposed.",Ergonomics,2025

The e-skin features a three-layer woven structure, with the outer layer made of PTFE (high dielectric constant, superhydrophobic), the inner layer composed of wool (hygroscopic, skin-friendly), and a middle layer embedded with silver-plated nylon (SPN) conductive yarns forming a flexible electrode array. Benefiting from its asymmetric design, this material exhibits excellent triboelectric performance (open-circuit voltage of 37 V, short-circuit current of 58 nA), breathability (341.9 mm/s), and mechanical durability (over 1000 cycles). Through modification with a polyacrylic acid coating, the PTFE side demonstrates superhydrophobicity (contact angle > 150°) and self-cleaning capabilities. In practical applications, this e-skin can accurately monitor the bending angle of the elbow joint (30°∼120°, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.979) and recognize sliding gestures through differences in voltage waveforms. Additionally, it can drive commercial electronic devices and charge capacitors (4.7 µF capacitor charged to 4.5 V within 100 s).

40683924,Analyzing social psychological impact on emotional expression through peer communication using crayfish optimization algorithm with deep learning model.,"In today’s digital age, people frequently interact with multiple devices simultaneously, significantly reshaping how they express emotions and communicate with peers. The insights gained will advance the fields of social psychology and human-computer interaction (HCI), informing the design of digital platforms that better support meaningful emotional and social interactions. Sentiment analysis (SA) identifies people’s emotions, attitudes, and sentiments towards a given target, like activities, people, services, organizations, products, and subjects. Emotion detection is a subdivision of SA as it forecasts the novel emotion instead of only maintaining negative, positive, or neutral. Emotion recognition has emerged as an important area of study that may report different valuable inputs. Emotion is expressed in numerous ways that are observed, namely written text, gestures, speech, and facial expressions. Emotional recognition in the text document is primarily a content-based classification problem containing ideas from natural language processing (NLP). NLP methods enhance the performance of learning-based models by combining the syntactic and semantic features of the text. To identify the emotion, a new deep learning (DL) model is applied to recognize emotional expression from text for improved results. This paper uses the Crayfish Optimization Algorithm and Deep Learning (SPIEEPC-COADL) method to analyze the Social Psychological Impact on Emotional Expression through Peer Communication. The presented SPIEEPC-COADL model aims to develop an effective method for detecting text-based emotional expressions to enhance HCI. Initially, the text pre-processing stage contains various levels to clean, normalize, and structure raw text data to improve the performance. Furthermore, the FastText method is employed for the word embedding process. Moreover, the variational autoencoder (VAE) model is implemented for emotion classification. Finally, the crayfish optimization algorithm (COA) adjusts the VAE model’s hyperparameter values, improving classification. The efficiency of the SPIEEPC-COADL model is examined using emotion detection from the text dataset. The comparison study of the SPIEEPC-COADL technique demonstrated a superior accuracy value of 99.07% over existing models.",Scientific reports,2025

However, achieving this accuracy is often hindered by the inherent limitations of thermal data, such as low resolution and poor contrast. This work addresses these challenges by proposing a novel, multifaceted approach that combines both deep learning and image processing techniques. We first introduce a unique dataset of thermal facial images captured with meticulous eye location annotations. To improve image clarity, we employ Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Subsequently, we explore the effectiveness of advanced YOLO models (YOLOv8 and YOLOv9) for accurate eye detection. Our experiments reveal that YOLOv8 with CLAHE-enhanced images achieved the highest accuracy (precision and recall of 1, mAP50 of 0.995, and mAP50-95 of 0.801), the YOLOv9 model also demonstrated excellent performance with a precision of 0.998, recall of 0.998, mAP-50 of 0.995, and mAP50-95 of 0.753.

In particular, new wave of deep learning methods have significantly advanced human speech recognition by obtaining fine-grained acoustic cues including pitch, an acoustic feature that can be a critical ingredient in understanding communicative intent. Pitch variation is in particular important for prosodic classification tasks (i.e., statements, questions, and exclamations), which is crucial in tonal and low resource languages such as Kurdish, where intonation holds significant semantic information. This paper presents the dataset of the Statements, Questions, or Exclamations Based on Sound Pitch (SQEBSP) which contains 12,660 professionally-recorded speech audio clips by 431 native Kurdish speakers who reside in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

All utterances were digitized at 16 kHz and then manually checked for correctness concerning pitch-based classification. The dataset contains equal representation from all three classes, about 4200 samples per class, and metadata such as speaker gender, age group, and sentence identifiers. The original audio files, alongside resources like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and waveform visualizations, can be found on Mendeley Data.

40665076,The digital interactive design of mirror painting under transformer based intelligent rendering methods.,"This study focuses on the intelligent rendering task of ""mirror painting"", aiming to develop a high-quality, real-time rendering method applicable to digital art, human-computer interaction, and game art scenarios. The core challenge lies in achieving high-fidelity local texture modeling and global style consistency under limited computational resources. Existing methods such as StyleSwin, Style-Aware Network (SANet), and Stable Diffusion exhibit weak structural consistency, severe style drift, or high computational costs, making it difficult to simultaneously balance speed and image quality. To address these challenges, this study proposes an intelligent rendering method called the Mamba-Swin-Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) rendering framework. The method integrates three key technologies. First, local features are extracted based on the Mamba state space model to effectively preserve brushstrokes and edge details. Second, Swin Transformer for global feature modeling is introduced to reduce complexity through sliding window attention mechanisms. Finally, style transfer optimization is carried out in combination with LoRA, maintaining style consistency while updating only a small number of parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves 34.2 dB in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, 0.91 in Structural Similarity Index Measure, and 0.18 in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity for image quality assessment.

40658990,A Multimodal Analysis of Online Information Foraging in Health-Related Topics Based on Stimulus-Engagement Alignment: Observational Feasibility Study.,"The recent increase in online health information-seeking has prompted extensive user appraisal of encountered content. Information consumption depends crucially on the quality of encountered information and the user's ability to evaluate it; yet, within the context of web-based, organic search behavior, few studies take into account both these aspects simultaneously. We aimed to explore a method to bridge these two aspects and grant even consideration to both the stimulus (web page content) and the user (ability to appraise encountered content). We examined novices and experts in information retrieval and appraisal to demonstrate a novel approach to studying information foraging theory: stimulus-engagement alignment (SEA). We sampled from experts and novices in information retrieval and assessment, asking participants to conduct a 10-minute search task with a specific information goal. We used an observational and a retrospective think-aloud protocol to collect data within the framework of an interview. Data from 3 streams (think-aloud, human-computer interaction, and screen content) were manually coded in the Reproducible Open Coding Kit standard and subsequently aligned and represented in a tabularized format with the R package {rock}. SEA scores were derived from designated code co-occurrences in specific segments of data within the stimulus data stream versus the think-aloud and human-computer interaction data streams. SEA scores represented a meaningful comparison of what participants encountered and what they engaged with. Operationalizing codes as either ""present"" or ""absent"" in a particular data stream allowed us to inspect not only which credibility cues participants engaged with with the most frequency, but also whether participants noticed the absence of cues. Code co-occurrence frequencies could thus indicate case-, time-, and context-sensitive information appraisal that also takes into account the quality of information encountered. Using SEA allowed us to retain epistemic access to idiosyncratic manifestations of both stimuli and engagement. In addition, by using the same coding scheme and designated co-occurrences across participants, we were able to pinpoint trends within our sample and subsamples. We believe our approach offers a powerful analysis encompassing the breadth and depth of data, both on par with each other in the feat of understanding organic, web-based search behavior.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025

40650801,Assessment of cognitive load in the context of neurosurgery.,"Image-guided neurosurgery demands precise depth perception to minimize cognitive burden during intricate navigational tasks. Existing evaluation methods rely heavily on subjective user feedback, which can be biased and inconsistent. This study uses a physiological measure via electroencephalography (EEG), to quantify cognitive load when using novel dynamic depth-cue visualizations. By comparing dynamic versus static rendering techniques, we aim to establish an objective framework for assessing and validating visualization strategies beyond traditional performance metrics. Twenty participants (experts in brain imaging) navigated to specified targets within a computed tomography angiography (CTA) volume using a tracked 3D pointer. We implemented three visualization methods (shading, ChromaDepth, aerial perspective) in both static and dynamic modes, randomized across 80 trials per subject. Continuous EEG was recorded via a Muse headband; raw signals were preprocessed and theta-band (4-7 Hz) power extracted for each trial. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA assessed the effects of visualization type and dynamic interaction on theta power. Dynamic visualization conditions yielded lower mean theta-band power compared to static conditions (Δ = 0.057 V2/Hz; F (1,19) = 6.00, p = 0.024), indicating reduced neural markers of cognitive load. No significant main effect was observed across visualization methods, nor their interaction with dynamic mode. These findings suggest that real-time feedback from pointer-driven interactions may alleviate mental effort regardless of the specific depth cue employed. Our exploratory results demonstrate the feasibility of using consumer-grade EEG to provide objective insights into cognitive load for surgical visualization techniques. Although limited by non-surgeon participants, the observed theta-power reductions under dynamic conditions support further investigation. Future work should correlate EEG-derived load measures with performance outcomes, involve practising neurosurgeons, and leverage high-density EEG or AI-driven adaptive visualization to refine and validate these preliminary findings.",International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,2025
40648734,High Anti-Swelling Zwitterion-Based Hydrogel with Merit Stretchability and Conductivity for Motion Detection and Information Transmission.,"Hydrogel sensors show unique advantages in underwater detection, ocean monitoring, and human-computer interaction because of their excellent flexibility, biocompatibility, high sensitivity, and environmental adaptability. However, due to the water environment, hydrogels will dissolve to a certain extent, resulting in insufficient mechanical strength, poor long-term stability, and signal interference. In this paper, a double-network structure was constructed by polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and poly([2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl]7 dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide) (PSBMA). The resultant PVA/PSBMA-PA hydrogel demonstrated notable swelling resistance, a property attributable to the incorporation of non-covalent interactions (electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding) through the addition of phytic acid (PA). The hydrogel exhibited high stretchability (maximum tensile strength up to 304 kPa), high conductivity (5.8 mS/cm), and anti-swelling (only 1.8% swelling occurred after 14 days of immersion in artificial seawater). Assembled as a sensor, it exhibited high strain sensitivity (0.77), a low detection limit (1%), and stable electrical properties after multiple tensile cycles. The utilization of PVA/PSBMA-PA hydrogel as a wearable sensor shows promise for detecting human joint movements, including those of the fingers, wrists, elbows, and knees. Due to the excellent resistance to swelling, the PVA/PSBMA-PA-based sensors are also suitable for underwater applications, enabling the detection of underwater mannequin motion. This study proposes an uncomplicated and pragmatic methodology for producing hydrogel sensors suitable for use within subaquatic environments, thereby concomitantly broadening the scope of applications for wearable electronic devices.","Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2025

Existing pupil detection algorithms still face challenges in maintaining robustness under variable lighting conditions and occlusion scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel pupil detection algorithm, ViMSA, based on the ViM model. This algorithm introduces weighted feature fusion, aiming to enable the model to adaptively learn the contribution of different feature patches to the pupil detection results; combines ViM with the MSA (multi-head self-attention) mechanism), aiming to integrate global features and improve the accuracy and robustness of pupil detection; and uses FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to convert the time-domain vector outer product in MSA into a frequency-domain dot product, in order to reduce the computational complexity of the model and improve the detection efficiency of the model. ViMSA was trained and tested on nearly 135,000 pupil images from 30 different datasets, demonstrating exceptional generalization capability. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ViMSA achieves 99.6% detection accuracy at five pixels with an RMSE of 1.67 pixels and a processing speed exceeding 100 FPS, meeting real-time monitoring requirements for various applications including operation under variable and uneven lighting conditions, assistive technology (enabling communication with neuro-motor disorder patients through pupil recognition), computer gaming, and automotive industry applications (enhancing traffic safety by monitoring drivers' cognitive states).","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025

Flexible pressure sensors have attracted significant attention due to their excellent flexibility, stability, and multifunctional integration. Herein, a multifunctional wearable MXene/polydopamine (PDA)@cotton fabric pressure sensor was developed by modifying weft-knitted cotton fabric based on a dual hydrogen bond self-assembly strategy.

40642925,Wide-range human physiological signal acquisition with carbonized composite nanofibers.,"Flexible pressure sensors provide a powerful platform for information acquisition from the surrounding environment and individual body with bendable, stretchable, conformal and biocompatible properties. However, current pressure sensors with high sensitivity often come at a high cost and have a limited pressure measurement range, which remarkably constrains their adaptability to the diverse physiological activities. Herein, we developed carbonized polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers (CPNs) by combining electrospinning with high-temperature carbonization. The synthesized CPNs feature low production costs, excellent stress transmission properties, and controllable electrical conductivity and morphologies, achieving substantial merits of flexible pressure detection. The dependence of pressure sensing performance on carbonization temperature, mass ratio of composite materials, film thickness, and surface microstructure design was systematically investigated. CPN/BC-based flexible pressure sensors (CFPSs) demonstrate an ultra-wide operating range from 0 to 250 kPa, high sensitivity (19.20 [kPa]<sup>-1</sup>), and rapid response and recovery times (62/32 ms).

40639397,Enhancing surface electromyographic signal recognition accuracy for trans-radial amputees using broad learning systems.,"Gesture recognition based on surface electromyography (sEMG) plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction. By analyzing sEMG signals generated from residual forearm muscle activity in trans-radial amputees, it is possible to predict their hand movement intentions, enabling the control of myoelectric prostheses. Previous studies on gesture classification for trans-radial amputees have shown that as the number of hand movement types increases, the accuracy of gesture classification significantly decreases. To this end, this paper proposed a novel approach that integrates image feature flattening (IFF) with broad learning system (BLS). The IFF method mapped data features into a three-dimensional image, which was then converted to grayscale and flattened into a one-dimensional vector. Finally, it was used as input to the BLS network for precise gesture classification. The proposed method was validated on 49 hand movement data from radial amputees in the Ninapro DB3 dataset. The results showed that the method not only significantly reduced classification time but also achieved a gesture recognition accuracy of up to 98.1%, demonstrating its strong potential for application in gesture recognition for trans-radial amputees.",Biomedical physics & engineering express,2025

It compared sentence production efficiency with identical communicative symbols in a traditional grid design versus a novel circular display, focusing on production times and error rates. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Participants produced two different sets of three-symbol sentences on two displays containing the same communicative symbols, grouped into semantic units by background color. One display used a standard grid design, while the other arranged symbols circularly around the screen's center. Participants completed the sentences consecutively on both displays, with sentence production times and error rates recorded for comparison. <b>Results:</b> The circular display yielded significantly faster sentence production times compared to the grid design. However, error rates for sentence completion were similar between the two display types. <b>Conclusions:</b> The findings suggest that a circular display orientation may enhance communicative efficiency for speech-generating devices controlled by eye gaze, potentially improving communication outcomes. These results advocate for exploring alternative display designs beyond the conventional grid format.",Disability and rehabilitation. Assistive technology,2025
40637428,External Ventricular Drain Placement Using Active Augmented Reality Guidance: A Proof of Concept of a Clinically Integrable System.,"Suboptimal placement occurs in 26% of external ventricular drain (EVD) procedures performed using traditional freehand methods. We developed a low-cost augmented reality stereotactic navigation system aimed at improving accuracy and safety of the procedure, which is readily compatible with existing Picture Archiving and Communication Systems and automated image segmentation algorithms. The system integrates cloud storage, image segmentation, trajectory planning, point-based image-to-patient registration, and real-time 3-dimensional guidance superimposed over the surgical field. As a proof of concept, 15 neurosurgeons, neurosurgical residents, and physician assistants used anatomical landmark-based registration to conduct 29 EVD placements on anatomical phantoms with small ventricles within a simulated surgical environment. From postoperative computed tomography, placement accuracy was assessed using the Kakarla grading scale, along with the distance to target and angular deviation. Twenty EVDs (69.0%; 95% CI, 52.1%-85.8%) were graded as optimal Kakarla 1 placements, 4 (13.8%; 95% CI, 1.2%-26.3%) as suboptimal Kakarla 2 placements, and 5 (17.2%; 95% CI, 3.5%-31.0%) as suboptimal Kakarla 3 placements. The mean distance to target was 9.49 mm (SD, 4.64 mm), and the mean angular deviation was 9.20° (SD, 6.35°). The mean workflow time was 22 minutes 45 seconds (SD, 11 minutes 38 seconds), and the system demonstrated a fiducial registration error of 4.00 mm (SD, 1.16 mm). Challenges related to human-computer interaction were identified, suggesting further refinement is needed to optimize usability. While the accuracy, user interface, and procedural time of the system require further refinement for clinical implementation, this proof of concept demonstrates the clinical and technical feasibility of an end-to-end 3-dimensional augmented reality system with the potential to enhance the safety and accuracy of EVD placements.","Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)",2025
40636034,"Exploring the impact of noise, language familiarity, and experimental settings on emotion recognition.","This work aims to understand the contextual factors affecting speech emotion recognition (SER), more specifically the current research investigates whether the identification of vocal emotional expressions of anger, fear, sadness, joy, and neutrality is affected by three factors: (a) the experimental setting, exploring vocal emotion recognition in both a controlled, soundproof laboratory and a more natural listening environment; (b) the effect of stimuli's background noise: sentences were presented with three different levels of noise to gradually increase the level of difficulty: one clear (no noise) condition and two noise conditions; (c) language familiarity, since the stimuli comprised Italian sentences, and participants were both native (Italians) and Dutch speakers, who did not know Italian. Dutch and Italian participants were involved in a vocal emotion recognition task carried out in two different experimental settings (realistic vs. laboratory). The stimuli were vocal utterances from the Italian EMOVO dataset, conveying emotions like anger, fear, sadness, joy, and neutrality, and were presented in three different noise conditions. Concerning the effect of the experimental setting, even in higher levels of background noise conditions, individuals possess the remarkable ability to discern emotional nuances conveyed through voice. Regarding familiarity with the language, differences in emotion recognition performance between the Italian and Dutch listeners were observed, but the error magnitude was contingent on the emotional categories. Higher noise levels reduced accuracy, but people could still discern emotions, especially prosody. The study highlighted that emotion recognition is influenced by variables such as listening context, background noise, and language familiarity. These results could be useful for developing robust Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems and improving human-computer interaction.",Frontiers in psychology,2025

Official practice is not available, leading candidates to practice with unofficial re-creations and with or without access to the stick and throttle used on the PBM.MethodOur between-subjects study with 152 cadets from the U.S. Military Academy evaluated the impact of mouse/keyboard or stick/throttle practice on the psychomotor portions of the PBM compared to a control group that was only presented with an informational video.ResultsThe results showed that practice with either input device resulted in improved performance relative to control on the PBM's two-dimensional airplane tracking task (ATT). For the simpler vertical tracking task (VTT), the mouse/keyboard group showed significantly worse performance than either stick/throttle practice or control groups, indicating a transfer cost from practicing with an alternative input device.ConclusionThe results suggest that becoming familiar with the unique dynamics of the ATT may be more important than practicing with the appropriate input device. Conversely, device-specific motor learning appears to be a more impactful determinant of performance for the simpler VTT. This indicates that transfer effects from alternative input devices depend in part on properties of the task.ApplicationThis research can inform practice policies for psychomotor test selection.",Human factors,2025

40610235,CONSeg: Voxelwise Uncertainty Quantification for Glioma Segmentation Using Conformal Prediction.,"Accurate glioma segmentation has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and treatment planning. Uncertainty quantification methods, including conformal prediction (CP), can enhance segmentation models reliability. CP quantifies uncertainty with statistical confidence guarantees. This study aims to use CP in glioma segmentation. We used the publicly available UCSF and UPenn glioma datasets, with the UCSF dataset (495 cases) split into training (70%), validation (10%), calibration (10%), and test (10%) sets, and the UPenn dataset (147 cases) divided into external calibration (30%) and external test (70%) sets. A UNet model was trained, and its optimal threshold was set to 0.5 using prediction normalization. To apply CP, the conformal threshold was selected based on the internal/external calibration nonconformity score, and CP was subsequently applied to the internal/external test sets, with coverage -the proportion of true labels within prediction sets-reported for all. We defined the uncertainty ratio (UR) and assessed its correlation with the Dice score coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95). Additionally, we categorized cases into certain and uncertain groups based on UR and compared their DSC and HD95. We also evaluate the correlation between UR and the evaluation metrics (DSC and HD95) of the BraTS fusion model segmentation (BFMS), and compare evaluation metrics in the certain and uncertain subgroups. The base model achieved a DSC of 0.86 and 0.83, and an HD95 of 7.35 and 11.71 on the internal and external test sets, respectively. The CP coverage was 0.9982 for the internal test set and 0.9977 for the external test set. Statistical analysis showed significant correlations between UR and evaluation metrics for test sets (p values <0.001). Additionally, certain cases had significantly better evaluation metrics (higher DSC and lower HD95) than uncertain cases in test sets and the BFMS (p values <0.001). CP effectively quantifies uncertainty in glioma segmentation. Using CONSeg improves the reliability of segmentation models and enhances human-computer interaction. Additionally, CONSeg can identify uncertain cases and suggest them for manual segmentation.

Classic emotion recognition methods usually rely on controlled stimuli, such as music and images, which does not allow for ecological validity and scope. This paper proposes the EmoTrans model, which uses the DEAP dataset to analyze physiological signals and facial video recordings. It consisted of EEG recordings from 32 viewers of 40 one-minute movie clips and facial videos from 22 participants, which can be used to analyze the emotional states based on variables; valence, arousal, dominance, and liking. To increase the model's validity, expert validation in the form of a survey by psychologists was conducted. The model integrates features extracted from EEG signals in the time, frequency, and wavelet domains as well as facial video data to provide a comprehensive understanding of emotional states. Our proposed EmoTrans architecture achieves the accuracies of 89.3%, 87.8%, 88.9%, and 89.1% for arousal, valence, dominance, and liking, respectively. EmoTrans achieved an impressive classification accuracy of 89% for emotions such as happiness, excitement, calmness, and distress, among others. Moreover, the Statistical significance of performance improvements was confirmed using a paired t-test, which showed that EmoTrans significantly outperforms baseline models. The model was validated with machine learning and deep learning classifiers and also by Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV). The proposed attention-based architecture effectively prioritizes the most relevant features from EEG and facial data, pushing the boundaries of emotion classification and offering a more nuanced understanding of human emotions across different states.",Scientific reports,2025
40593954,Spatial correlation guided cross scale feature fusion for age and gender estimation.,"To address the challenges of age and gender recognition in uncontrolled scenarios with facial absence or severe occlusion, this paper proposes a Spatial Correlation Guided Cross Scale Feature Fusion Network (SCGNet). The proposed method specifically tackles the limitations of existing approaches that heavily rely on facial features, which become unreliable under partial/complete occlusion scenarios. The method integrates multi-granularity semantic features through a Cross-Scale Combination (CSC) module, enhances local detail representation using a Local Feature Guided Fusion (LFGF) module, and designs a Spatial Correlation Composition Analysis (SCCA) module based on Getis-Ord Gi* statistics for feature reorganization, effectively resolving interference from non-informative regions. The SCCA module introduces a novel bipartite grouping mechanism that leverages hotspot detection to preserve discriminative body features when facial cues are unavailable. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SCGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) 4.01% for age estimation on IMDB-Clean (2.9% improvement over VOLO-D1) and highest gender classification accuracy on IMDB-Clean, UTKFace, and Lagenda datasets, showing improvements in cross-scene adaptability compared to VOLO and MiVOLO models respectively. Notably, the method maintains gender discrimination accuracy under complete facial occlusion scenarios, validating the effectiveness of spatial correlation modeling for non-facial feature reasoning, maintaining 97.32% gender accuracy even with complete facial occlusion on Lagenda dataset. The proposed architecture shows 73.30% CS@5 for age prediction in cross-domain testing, demonstrating superior cross-scene adaptability compared to VOLO (69.72%) and MiVOLO (71.27%).

40580080,Exploring the Relationship Between Mental Boundary Strength and Phonetic Accommodation.,"We motivate a possible relationship between the psychological concept of mental boundaries and the linguistic phenomenon of phonetic accommodation, proposing that thinner boundaries may indicate a greater disposition to phonetically adapt to an interlocutor. To enable research on this relationship with German speakers, we translated the English short version of the Boundary Questionnaire (BQ-Sh), an established instrument for measuring the strength of mental boundaries, and demonstrated that the resulting German adaptation (BQ-Sh-G) can be used equivalently to the BQ-Sh. As the Big Five personality traits have previously been considered in research on both mental boundaries and phonetic accommodation, we explored the relationship between the BQ-Sh-G and the NEO-Five Factor Inventory. Consistent with previous literature, the BQ-Sh-G score correlated positively with Neuroticism and Openness, as well as negatively with Conscientiousness. We collected BQ-Sh-G scores from participants of an experiment on phonetic accommodation in a human-computer interaction context, specifically investigating the realization of the word ending 〈-ig〉 and the intonation of wh-questions in German. The analysis revealed a tendency for thicker mental boundaries to correspond with more convergence to 〈-ig〉 variants. Taking into account the results of previous work exploring the influence of the Big Five on the same data, we conclude that speakers may accommodate to different types of phonetic features depending on different personality traits. We encourage future work to investigate this further, while also exploring the predictive potential of the boundary construct with respect to a general disposition to phonetic accommodation, that is, examining a large number of phonetic features simultaneously.",Language and speech,2025

This challenge can be met with a novel Enhanced Convolutional Transformer with Adaptive Tuna Swarm Optimization (ECT-ATSO) recognition framework proposed for double-handed sign language. In order to improve both model generalization and image quality, preprocessing is applied to images prior to prediction, and the proposed dataset is organized to handle multiple dynamic words. Feature graining is employed to obtain local features, and the ViT transformer architecture is then utilized to capture global features from the preprocessed images. After concatenation, this generates a feature map that is then divided into various words using an Inverted Residual Feed-Forward Network (IRFFN). Using the Tuna Swarm Optimization (TSO) algorithm in its enhanced form, the provided Enhanced Convolutional Transformer (ECT) model is optimally tuned to handle the problem dimensions with convergence problem parameters. In order to solve local optimization constraints when adjusting the position for the tuna update process, a mutation operator was introduced. The dataset visualization that demonstrates the best effectiveness compared to alternative cutting-edge methods, recognition accuracy, and convergences serves as a means to measure performance of this suggested framework.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025

40567537,Tracking and its Potential for Older Adults with Memory Concerns.,"Much research on older people with memory concerns is focused on tracking and informed by the priorities of others. In this paper, we seek to understand the potential that people with memory concerns see in tracking. We conducted interviews with 29 participants with concerns about their memory and engaged in an affective writing approach. We find a range of potentials that can be traced to how participants are already self-tracking. Emotions associated with these potentials vary: from acceptance to resistance, and positive anticipation to aversion. Participants are emotionally motivated to foreclose possibilities in some instances and keep them open in others. While individual and unique, potential is structured by forces that include individual routines, relationships with others, and macro-level institutions and cultural contexts. We reflect on these findings in the context of research on self-tracking with older adults, designing with ambiguity, and forces that structure the experience of living with memory concerns.",Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on human factors in computing systems.

Through the decoding of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), this system can rapidly and accurately identify the intentions of subjects, thereby meeting the practical demands of daily medical scenarios. Firstly, an SSVEP stimulation interface and an electroencephalogram (EEG) signal acquisition software were designed, which enable the system to execute multi-target and multi-task operations while also incorporating data visualization functionality. Secondly, the EEG signals recorded from the occipital region were decomposed into eight sub-frequency bands using filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA). Subsequently, the similarity between each sub-band signal and the reference signals was computed to achieve efficient SSVEP decoding. Finally, 15 subjects were recruited to participate in the online evaluation of the system. The experimental results indicated that in real-world scenarios, the system achieved an average accuracy of 85.19% in identifying the intentions of the subjects, and an information transfer rate (ITR) of 37.52 bit/min.

40566187,Research on Task Complexity Measurements in Human-Computer Interaction in Nuclear Power Plant DCS Systems Based on Emergency Operating Procedures.,"Within the scope of digital transformation in nuclear power plants (NPPs), task complexity in human-computer interaction (HCI) has become a critical factor affecting the safe and stable operation of NPPs. This study systematically reviews and analyzes existing complexity sources and assessment methods and suggests that complexity is primarily driven by core factors such as the quantity of, variety of, and relationships between elements. By innovatively introducing Halstead's <i>E</i> measure, this study constructs a quantitative model of dynamic task execution complexity (TEC), addressing the limitations of traditional entropy-based metrics in analyzing interactive processes. By combining entropy metrics and the <i>E</i> measure, a task complexity quantification framework is established, encompassing both the task execution and intrinsic dimensions. Specifically, Halstead's <i>E</i> measure focuses on analyzing operators and operands, defining interaction symbols between humans and interfaces to quantify task execution complexity (TEC). Entropy metrics, on the other hand, measure task logical complexity (TLC), task scale complexity (TSC), and task information complexity (TIC) based on the intrinsic structure and scale of tasks. Finally, the weighted Euclidean norm of these four factors determines the task complexity (TC) of each step. Taking the emergency operating procedures (EOP) for a small-break loss-of-coolant accident (SLOCA) in an NPP as an example, the entropy and <i>E</i> metrics are used to calculate the task complexity of each step, followed by experimental validation using NASA-TLX task load scores and step execution time for regression analysis. The results show that task complexity is significantly positively correlated with NASA-TLX subjective scores and task execution time, with the determination coefficients reaching 0.679 and 0.785, respectively. This indicates that the complexity metrics have high explanatory power, showing that the complexity quantification model is effective and has certain application value in improving human-computer interfaces and emergency procedures.","Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)",2025

40550837,Recognizing American Sign Language gestures efficiently and accurately using a hybrid transformer model.,"Gesture recognition plays a vital role in computer vision, especially for interpreting sign language and enabling human-computer interaction. Many existing methods struggle with challenges like heavy computational demands, difficulty in understanding long-range relationships, sensitivity to background noise, and poor performance in varied environments. While CNNs excel at capturing local details, they often miss the bigger picture. Vision Transformers, on the other hand, are better at modeling global context but usually require significantly more computational resources, limiting their use in real-time systems. To tackle these issues, we propose a Hybrid Transformer-CNN model that combines the strengths of both architectures. Our approach begins with CNN layers that extract detailed local features from both the overall hand and specific hand regions. These CNN features are then refined by a Vision Transformer module, which captures long-range dependencies and global contextual information within the gesture. This integration allows the model to effectively recognize subtle hand movements while maintaining computational efficiency. Tested on the ASL Alphabet dataset, our model achieves a high accuracy of 99.97%, runs at 110 frames per second, and requires only 5.0 GFLOPs-much less than traditional Vision Transformer models, which need over twice the computational power. Central to this success is our feature fusion strategy using element-wise multiplication, which helps the model focus on important gesture details while suppressing background noise. Additionally, we employ advanced data augmentation techniques and a training approach incorporating contrastive learning and domain adaptation to boost robustness. Overall, this work offers a practical and powerful solution for gesture recognition, striking an optimal balance between accuracy, speed, and efficiency-an important step toward real-world applications.",Scientific reports,2025
40549052,"Why axis inversion? Optimizing interactions between users, interfaces, and visual displays in 3D environments.","From video games to laparoscopic surgeries, differences in users' abilities to adapt to new control schemes can have significant, even deadly impacts on performance. Starting with the question of why some video game players invert the y-axis on their console controllers, this work aims to provide a foundation for future investigations of how control schemes can significantly impact performance. We argue that fragmented research across disciplines hinders a unified understanding of how the spatial relationships between users, interfaces, and visual displays affect performance. Therefore, we begin with a multidisciplinary literature synthesis, clarifying existing findings, and identifying methodological inconsistencies that contribute to conflicting results. We then explore the relationship between key behavioral and cognitive factors and y-axis inversion preference in a group of experienced 3rd person gamers. Based on these preliminary results, we propose a ""general purpose"" framework to systematically investigate how control inversion and visual input influence perception and performance across various movement goals. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to evaluate performance in the context of a common and challenging laparoscopic procedure, and how it can be generalized to assess and predict sensorimotor compatibility effects across a wide variety of real-world situations.",Cognitive research: principles and implications,2025

In this work, we develop a polyacrylamide (PAAm)-based hybrid composite integrated with a conductive hydrogel to simultaneously enhance mechanical robustness and electrical performance for real-time motion sensing. The composite features a double-network hydrogel (DNH) composed of PAAm and sodium alginate, reinforced with MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets and ethylene glycol-doped PEDOT:PSS (DNH/MoS<sub>2</sub>NS/EG-PEDOT:PSS), yielding a highly stretchable, adhesive, and conductive material. The adhesive layer exhibits excellent mechanical properties, including a maximum strain of over 500% and a peeling force of approximately 25 N/m, while the conductive layer maintains over 300% stretchability with significantly improved electrical conductivity. The strain sensor demonstrates a gauge factor (GF) of approximately 1.67 with excellent linearity (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> ≈ 0.97), along with stable signal response over 10,000 loading/unloading cycles with minimal hysteresis.

40545207,A mobile relational agent to enhance atrial fibrillation self-care: Primary and secondary outcomes of a randomized controlled trial.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) requires long-term adherence to oral anticoagulation and self-care. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a smartphone-based relational agent and heart rhythm monitor with the primary outcome of anticoagulation adherence and secondary outcomes of quality of life (QOL) and health care utilization. The trial enrolled individuals with Atrial fibrillation (AF) taking anticoagulation. Intervention participants received a smartphone-based relational agent for disease education, adherence monitoring, and self-care, and a heart rate and rhythm monitor. Attention control participants received a smartphone health education application and the same heart monitor. Participants had baseline and 4-, 8-, and 12-month visits. The primary outcome was 12-month proportion of days covered (PDC) ascertained with pharmacy claims. From January, 2020 to April, 2022, the trial enrolled 243 participants (age 70.8 ± 9.8 years; 64.2% female; 30.5% Black race). The adjusted mean PDC at 12 months in the intervention arm was 0.88 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.84-0.93) and in the attention control 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81-0.90) with no difference in odds of PDC ≥ 0.80 in intervention compared to the control (Odds Ratio, 1.26 [95% CI, 0.66-2.38]). Self-reported nonadherence and QOL did not differ by study arm. The event rates for health care utilization were significantly less for intervention than attention control participants as measured by emergency room visits and hospitalizations (P < .001) and number of days hospitalized (P = .004).

40539498,CNFs/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-SiC SBD flexible e-skin to achieve dual function sensing of pressure and temperature.,"Human skin has the complex function of sensing pressure, strain, friction, temperature, and humidity. Flexible electronic skin (e-skin) plays a key role in advancing intelligent human-computer interaction and wearable health monitoring devices. However, achieving effective integration of multifunctional sensors while minimizing potential interference between them is a significant challenge. In this paper, we use an improved electrostatic spinning layered integration process to fabricate a sandwich-structured CNFs/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-SiC SBD pressure-temperature dual-mode e-skin, in which the top and bottom layers are composed of the temperature-sensitive material SiC SBD, which also functions as capacitive electrodes, forming a capacitive pressure sensor together with the pressure-sensitive material CNFs/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the middle layer.

40534907,Developing interactive VR-based digital therapeutics for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT): a structured framework for the digital transformation integrating gamification and multimodal arts.,"Digital therapeutics (DTx) require structured methodologies to translate evidence-based psychotherapy into immersive digital formats. In response to this need, this study proposes a practical framework for the digital transformation of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) into an interactive virtual reality (VR) system. DTx-ACT, designed as a therapeutic intervention for depression, is a VR-based system that delivers ACT through an immersive virtual experience. Its development followed five structured phases: preliminary research, design, development, advancement, and commercialization. The original ACT protocol was modularized into VR environments using the Session Structuring System (SSS) model. To enhance user engagement, gamification and multimodal arts strategies were incorporated. As part of the development process, evaluation metrics were defined to assess both clinical effectiveness and user interaction. The final system comprises five immersive VR sessions, each lasting 6 to 12 minutes. These modules incorporate ACT metaphors, interactive tasks, and multisensory feedback to enhance therapeutic engagement. To support the digital transformation of ACT, three core components were established: (1) an evidence-based therapeutic protocol, (2) interactive VR elements-including gamification and multimodal arts-based guidance, and (3) a data-driven evaluation framework. Evaluation metrics, derived from a pilot study, were integrated into the system, which collects clinical and interaction data-such as real-time behavioral patterns and sensor-based information-to enable comprehensive evaluation. Based on this development process, we propose a practical framework for designing interactive VR-based DTx. This framework bridges clinical structure, creative engagement, and real-time evaluation to support personalized and scalable applications in digital mental healthcare. It contributes to the standardization of digital transformation in evidence-based therapy and offers a transferable model for future therapeutic content development.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2025

This paper introduces a mechanomyography (MMG) signal dataset intended for application in human-computer interaction (HCI) research. The dataset is obtained from integrated sensor data, capturing mechanical signals from muscle activity via the accelerometer, augmented by the gyroscope for motion analysis. The dataset comprises 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscope data from 43 participants, ranging in age from 18 to 69 years, exhibiting a male-to-female distribution of 60 % to 40 % respectively. The dataset includes the following 11 gestures: clapping, coin flipping, finger snapping, fist making, horizontal wrist extension, index finger flicking, index thumb tapping, shooting, thumb up, wrist extension, and wrist flexion. A novel, assembled, and manufactured wearable system collected data from the main muscles that end at the wrist, just below the watch strap. These muscles include flexors and extensors, which work together to move the wrist and fingers when making the hand gestures listed above. Every participant completed a total of fifty repetitions for each of the eleven hand motions, resulting in 550 samples per subject. Before recording the signals, a demographic survey with the participants is conducted. Researchers focusing on classification, recognition, and prediction can use the gathered data to develop MMG-based hand motion controller systems. The collected data can also serve as a reference for developing a model using artificial intelligence (e.g., a deep learning or machine learning model) that is capable of identifying gesture-related MMG signals. It is suggested that the proposed dataset is used to evaluate existing datasets in the literature or to validate artificial intelligence models developed with alternative datasets through the participant-independent evaluation approach. This dataset can be useful in a variety of applications and fields, including interaction between humans and robots, gaming, assistive technology, healthcare observation, and sports analytics, to name a few specific examples.",Data in brief,2025
41036253,"Privacy-, linguistic-, and information-preserving synthesis of clinical documentation through generative agents.","The widespread adoption of generative agents (GAs) is reshaping the healthcare landscape. Nonetheless, broad utilization is impeded by restricted access to high-quality, interoperable clinical documentation from electronic health records (EHRs) due to persistent legal, ethical, and technical barriers. Synthetic health data generation (SHDG), leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs) instantiated as GAs, could offer a practical solution by creating synthetic patient information that mimics genuine EHRs. The use of LLMs, however, is not without issues; significant concerns remain regarding privacy, potential bias propagation, the risk of generating inaccurate or misleading content, and the lack of transparency in how these models make decisions. We therefore propose a privacy-, linguistic-, and information-preserving SHDG protocol that employs multiple context-aware, role-specific GAs. Guided by targeted prompting and authentic EHRs-serving as structural and linguistic templates-role-specific GAs can, in principle, operate collaboratively through multi-turn interactions. We theorized that utilizing GAs in this fashion permits LLMs not only to produce synthetic EHRs that are accurate, consistent, and contextually appropriate, but also to expose the underlying decision-making process. To test this hypothesis, we developed a no-code GA-driven SHDG workflow as a proof of concept, which was implemented within a predefined, multi-layered data science infrastructure (DSI) stack-an integrated ensemble of software and hardware designed to support rapid prototyping and deployment. The DSI stack streamlines implementation for healthcare professionals, improving accessibility, usability, and cybersecurity. To deploy and validate GA-assisted workflows, we implemented a fully automated SHDG evaluation framework-co-developed with GenAI technology-which holistically compares the informational and linguistic features of synthetic, anonymized, and real EHRs at both the document and corpus levels. Our findings highlight that SHDG implemented through GAs offers a scalable, transparent, and reproducible methodology for unlocking the potential of clinical documentation to drive innovation, accelerate research, and advance the development of learning health systems.

Privacy-preserving techniques play a vital role in safeguarding sensitive user data while maintaining system efficiency. The rising tendency of cybersecurity threats and the need to recognize harmful activities in heterogeneous but resource-constrained settings have led to the development of sophisticated intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for quickly identifying intrusion efforts. Conventional IDSs are becoming more inefficient in classifying new attacks (zero-day attacks) whose designs are similar to any threat signatures. To reduce these restrictions, projected IDS depend on deep learning (DL).

41027964,Enhanced intrusion detection in cybersecurity through dimensionality reduction and explainable artificial intelligence.,"Cybersecurity is one of the applications of controls, procedures, and technologies for protecting data, networks, programs, and systems from potential cyber threats. Malicious threats have become complex, and the leading task is to recognize obfuscated and mysterious malware, as the malware inventors utilize dissimilar evasion models for data covering to avert recognition by intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Artificial intelligence (AI) usage in cybersecurity is gradually becoming familiar, but the main task is the absence of interpretability and transparency of AI methods. Explainable AI (XAI) can tackle this problem by improving the understandability of AI techniques, permitting cyber-security experts to comprehend the decisions created by these methods and to recognize biases or errors. Recently, Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have delivered automatic analytical intrusion detection procedures, providing numerous advantages. This study proposes an Enhanced Intrusion Detection in Cybersecurity through Dimensionality Reduction and Explainable Artificial Intelligence with Attention Mechanism in Deep Learning (EIDCDR-XAIADL) model. The main intention of the proposed EIDCDR-XAIADL model is to deliver a robust cybersecurity system that combines XAI to address the attacks. Initially, the proposed EIDCDR-XAIADL technique performs data normalization by using mean normalization to ensure uniform scaling of network traffic data. The multiverse optimization (MVO) technique selects the most appropriate and discriminative features. For the cybersecurity attack classification process, the hybrid of convolutional neural network (CNN), bi-directional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU), and attention mechanism (CNN-BiGRU-AM) technique is implemented. Moreover, the antlion optimization (ALO) technique adjusts the hyperparameter values of the CNN-BiGRU-AM method optimally and results in more excellent classification performance. Finally, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is utilized as an XAI technique to enhance threat detection and decision-making by providing trustworthy insights into AI-driven security systems. The experimental evaluation of the EIDCDR-XAIADL approach is examined under dual datasets. The experimental validation of the EIDCDR-XAIADL approach demonstrated a superior accuracy value of 99.19% and 99.12% under NSLKDD and CICIDS 2017 datasets.",Scientific reports,2025
41027927,Federated transfer learning for rare attack class detection in network intrusion detection systems.,"Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach for training machine learning models with minimal data sharing, enhancing privacy and performance. However, building effective FL-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) remains challenging due to the need for large, diverse training datasets. Identifying rare attack types with limited instances is a persistent obstacle, and their detection is critical in cybersecurity. This research introduces a novel FL framework to address these challenges. By incorporating adaptive, personalized layers at the client level, the model reduces false alarm rates for zero-day attack types and improves the detection of rare classes. The model also leverages Transfer Learning (TL) to identify zero-day attacks, where client-specific gradients are collected and used to update a global model on the server side after multiple rounds of exposure to new data. The proposed sustainable framework aims to disseminate knowledge about rare attack types across clients through a server-based global model within the FL ecosystem. This study achieves two main objectives: (i) improving the detection of rare attack classes and (ii) identifying zero-day attacks in a NIDS context. Evaluations on the CSE-CICIDS-2018, Edge IIoT, and UNSW-NB 15 datasets, which encompass diverse class distributions, demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing models in detecting and handling rare and novel attack types. The proposed model achieves 98.90% accuracy on CICIDS 2018, 98.70% on UNSW-NB 15, and 97.92% on Edge-IIoT, surpassing the FL-TL-CNN model by 2.78%, 1.51%, and 2.03%, respectively.

41013107,Development and Evaluation of a Novel IoT Testbed for Enhancing Security with Machine Learning-Based Threat Detection.,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized industries by enabling seamless data exchange between billions of connected devices. However, the rapid proliferation of IoT devices has introduced significant security challenges, as many of these devices lack robust protection against cyber threats such as data breaches and denial-of-service attacks. Addressing these vulnerabilities is critical to maintaining the integrity and trust of IoT ecosystems. Traditional cybersecurity solutions often fail in dynamic, heterogeneous IoT environments due to device diversity, limited computational resources, and inconsistent communication protocols, which hinder the deployment of uniform and scalable security mechanisms. Moreover, there is a notable lack of realistic, high-quality datasets for training and evaluating machine learning (ML) models for IoT security, limiting their effectiveness in detecting complex and evolving threats. This paper presents the development and implementation of a novel physical smart office/home testbed designed to evaluate ML algorithms for detecting and mitigating IoT security vulnerabilities. The testbed replicates a real-world office environment, integrating a variety of IoT devices, such as different types of sensors, cameras, smart plugs, and workstations, within a network generating authentic traffic patterns. By simulating diverse attack scenarios including unauthorized access and network intrusions, the testbed provides a controlled platform to train, test, and validate ML-based anomaly detection systems. Experimental results show that the XGBoost model achieved a balanced accuracy of up to 99.977% on testbed-generated data, comparable to 99.985% on the benchmark IoT-23 dataset. Notably, the SVM model achieved up to 96.71% accuracy using our testbed data, outperforming its results on IoT-23, which peaked at 94.572%. The findings demonstrate the testbed's effectiveness in enabling realistic security evaluations and ability to generate real-world datasets, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for advancing IoT security research. This work contributes to the development of more resilient and adaptive security frameworks, offering valuable insights for safeguarding critical IoT infrastructures against evolving threats.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025
41008103,"An Extended Epistemic Framework Beyond Probability for Quantum Information Processing with Applications in Security, Artificial Intelligence, and Financial Computing.","In this work, we propose a novel quantum-informed epistemic framework that extends the classical notion of probability by integrating plausibility, credibility, and possibility as distinct yet complementary measures of uncertainty. This enriched quadruple (P, Pl, Cr, Ps) enables a deeper characterization of quantum systems and decision-making processes under partial, noisy, or ambiguous information. Our formalism generalizes the Born rule within a multi-valued logic structure, linking Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs) with data-driven plausibility estimators, agent-based credibility priors, and fuzzy-theoretic possibility functions. We develop a hybrid classical-quantum inference engine that computes a vectorial aggregation of the quadruples, enhancing robustness and semantic expressivity in contexts where classical probability fails to capture non-Kolmogorovian phenomena such as entanglement, contextuality, or decoherence. The approach is validated through three real-world application domains-quantum cybersecurity, quantum AI, and financial computing-where the proposed model outperforms standard probabilistic reasoning in terms of accuracy, resilience to noise, interpretability, and decision stability. Comparative analysis against QBism, Dempster-Shafer, and fuzzy quantum logic further demonstrates the uniqueness of architecture in both operational semantics and practical outcomes. This contribution lays the groundwork for a new theory of epistemic quantum computing capable of modelling and acting under uncertainty beyond traditional paradigms.","Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)",2025
41008018,Research on Joint Game-Theoretic Modeling of Network Attack and Defense Under Incomplete Information.,"In the face of increasingly severe cybersecurity threats, incomplete information and environmental dynamics have become central challenges in network attack-defense scenarios. In real-world network environments, defenders often find it difficult to fully perceive attack behaviors and network states, leading to a high degree of uncertainty in the system. Traditional approaches are inadequate in dealing with the diversification of attack strategies and the dynamic evolution of network structures, making it difficult to achieve highly adaptive defense strategies and efficient multi-agent coordination. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent network defense approach based on joint game modeling, termed JG-Defense (Joint Game-based Defense), which aims to enhance the efficiency and robustness of defense decision-making in environments characterized by incomplete information. The method integrates Bayesian game theory, graph neural networks, and a proximal policy optimization framework, and it introduces two core mechanisms. First, a Dynamic Communication Graph Neural Network (DCGNN) is used to model the dynamic network structure, improving the perception of topological changes and attack evolution trends. A multi-agent communication mechanism is incorporated within the DCGNN to enable the sharing of local observations and strategy coordination, thereby enhancing global consistency. Second, a joint game loss function is constructed to embed the game equilibrium objective into the reinforcement learning process, optimizing both the rationality and long-term benefit of agent strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that JG-Defense outperforms the Cybermonic model by 15.83% in overall defense performance. Furthermore, under the traditional PPO loss function, the DCGNN model improves defense performance by 11.81% compared to the Cybermonic model. These results verify that the proposed integrated approach achieves superior global strategy coordination in dynamic attack-defense scenarios with incomplete information.","Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)",2025

With its advanced capabilities, AI can automate tasks, analyze large datasets, and accurately identify vulnerabilities.

In the ever-growing field of IoT environments, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) threats pose an essential challenge, cooperating with the reliability of these methods. These attacks are usually utilized in real-time to write down e-commerce platforms, government websites, and banking systems. To deal with the DDoS attacks, there's an increased interest in decentralized learning methods, especially federated learning (FL), a newly acquired enhanced examination from the cyberattack cooperatively trained deep learning (DL) methods with dispersed cyber threats summaries. The recommendation of FL resolves the data privacy problem successfully.

40997099,A GAN-Based Approach for enhancing security in satellite based IoT networks using MPI enabled HPC.,"Satellite Internet of Things (IoT) networks based on satellites are becoming increasingly critical for mission-critical applications, including disaster recovery, environmental surveillance, and remote sensing. While becoming more widespread, they are also more vulnerable to various risks, particularly due to the heterogeneous communication technologies they support and the limited computing capacity on each device. When such IoT systems are connected with central HighPerformance Computing (HPC) clouds, particularly by satellite links, new security issues arise, the primary one being the secure transmission of confidential information. To overcome such challenges, this research proposes a new security framework termed DLGAN (Deep Learning-based Generative Adversarial Network), specially designed for satellite-based IoT scenarios. The model leverages the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for real-time anomaly detection, combined with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate realistic synthetic attack data, thereby addressing the challenge of skewed datasets prevalent in cybersecurity research. Since training GANs may be computationally expensive, the model is optimized to run on an HPC system via the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to enable scalable parallel processing of huge IoT data. Fundamentally, the DLGAN model is based on a generator/discriminator mechanism for effectively distinguishing network traffic as either benign or malicious, with the capability to detect 14 different types of attacks. By harnessingAI-enabled GPUs in the HPC cloud, the system can provide fast and accurate detection while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the framework significantly enhances detection accuracy, reduces training time, and scales well with large data volumes, making it highly suitable for real-time security operations. In total, this study highlights how integrating advanced deep learning technologies with HPC-based distributed environments can deliver an efficient and dynamic defense mechanism for contemporary IoT networks. The envisaged solution is unique in its ability to scale, maximize efficiency, and resist attacks while securing satellite-based IoT infrastructures.",PloS one,2025

Frameworks and standards currently exist, offering cybersecurity regulatory guidelines for organizations both locally and internationally, as evidenced in the literature. However, research on information security culture (ISC) within universities remains limited. Moreover, there is a notable absence of professional and academic investigations into ISC. In this article we aim to thoroughly examine ISC in universities through four main objectives. First, we will identify essential knowledge areas (KAs) in this field. Second, we will analyze best practices (BPs) used to promote security culture in universities. Third, we will explore where these practices can be applied across different university areas. Finally, we will create a detailed taxonomy to organize the aspects of ISC in university settings. We employed a multivocal literature review (MLR) approach to identify the primary KAs and BPs for understanding and enhancing security culture in universities. We scrutinized 81 primary studies from formal (FL; peer-reviewed) and grey literature (GL; blogs, web pages, white papers). These studies span the past 14 years, from 2010 to 2024. We identified 12 main KAs and 76 best practice areas from both FL and GL. Our findings have enabled us to establish a taxonomy of security culture in universities.

40989373,SA3C-ID: a novel network intrusion detection model using feature selection and adversarial training.,"With the continuous proliferation of emerging technologies such as cloud computing, 5G networks, and the Internet of Things, the field of cybersecurity is facing an increasing number of complex challenges. Network intrusion detection systems, as a fundamental part of network security, have become increasingly significant. However, traditional intrusion detection methods exhibit several limitations, including insufficient feature extraction from network data, high model complexity, and data imbalance, which result in issues like low detection efficiency, as well as frequent false positives and missed alarms. To address the above issues, this article proposed an adversarial intrusion detection model (Soft Adversarial Asynchronous Actor-Critic Intrusion Detection, SA3C-ID) based on reinforcement learning. Firstly, the raw dataset is preprocessed <i>via</i> one-hot encoding and standardization. Subsequently, the refined data undergoes feature selection employing an improved pigeon-inspired optimizer (PIO) algorithm. This operation eliminates redundant and irrelevant features, consequently reducing data dimensionality while maintaining critical information. Next, the network intrusion detection process is modeled as a Markov decision process and integrated with the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm, with a view to constructing agents; In the context of adversarial training, two agents, designated as the attacker and the defender, are defined to perform asynchronous adversarial training. During this training process, both agents calculate the reward value, update their respective strategies, and transfer parameters based on the classification results. Finally, to verify the robustness and generalization ability of the SA3C-ID model, ablation experiments and comparative evaluations are conducted on two benchmark datasets, NSL-KDD and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. The experimental results demonstrate that SA3C-ID exhibits superior performance in comparison to other prevalent intrusion detection models. The F1-score attained by SA3C-ID was 92.58% and 98.76% on the NSL-KDD and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets, respectively.",PeerJ. Computer science,2025
40982563,A fusion safety and security analysis framework for intelligent and connected vehicles.,"Driven by advancements in emerging technologies and data-driven innovations, the global automotive industry is focusing on intelligent and connected vehicles (ICVs), which involve complex electronic systems and vast data interactions.

40979690,Wearing a fur coat in the summertime: Should digital pathology redefine medical imaging?,"Slides are data. Once digitized, they function like any enterprise asset: accessible anywhere, ready for AI, and integrated into cloud workflows. But in pathology, they enter a realm of clinical complexity-demanding systems that handle nuance, integrate diverse data streams, scale effectively, enable computational exploration, and enforce rigorous security. Although the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard revolutionized radiology, it is imperative to explore its adequacy in addressing modern digital pathology's orchestration needs. Designed more than 30 years ago, DICOM reflects assumptions and architectural choices that predate modular software, cloud computing, and AI-driven workflows. This article shows that by embedding metadata, annotations, and communication protocols into a unified container, DICOM limits interoperability and exposes architectural vulnerabilities. The article begins by examining these innate design risks, then challenges DICOM's interoperability claims, and ultimately presents a modular, standards-aligned alternative. The article argues that separating image data from orchestration logic improves scalability, security, and performance. Standards such as HL7 FHIR (Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and modern databases manage clinical metadata; formats like Scalable Vector Graphics handle annotations; and fast, cloud-native file transfer protocols, and microservices support tile-level image access. This separation of concerns allows each component to evolve independently, optimizes performance across the system, and better adapts to emerging AI-driven workflows-capabilities that are inherently constrained in monolithic architectures where these elements are tightly coupled. It further shows that security requirements should not be embedded within the DICOM standard itself. Instead, security must be addressed through a layered, format-independent framework that spans systems, networks, applications, and data governance. Security is not a discrete feature but an overarching discipline-defined by its own evolving set of standards and best practices. Overlays such as those outlined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology SP 800-53 support modern Transport Layer Security, single sign-on, cryptographic hashing, and other controls that protect data streams without imposing architectural constraints or restricting technological choices. Pathology stands at a rare inflection point. Unlike radiology, where DICOM is deeply entrenched, pathology workflows still operate in polyglot environments-leveraging proprietary formats, hybrid standards, and emerging cloud-native tools. This diversity, often seen as a limitation, offers a clean slate: an opportunity to architect a modern, modular infrastructure free from legacy constraints. While a full departure from DICOM is unnecessary, pathology is uniquely positioned to prototype the future-to define a more flexible, secure, and interoperable model that other domains in medical imaging may one day follow.

However, integrating open-source components, such as their open-source software controlling system, raises significant cybersecurity concerns. This paper investigates cybersecurity vulnerability targeting an open-source medical syringe pump. We present a DDoS attack that alters the pump's operation, potentially leading to over-infusion or under-infusion of medication. We then assess the implications of these security flaws on patient safety and device reliability. Based on this assessment, we propose mitigation strategies that involve hardware modifications to enhance the device's resistance to such attacks and change designs for the 3D printing hardware pieces for open electronics. This research highlights the urgent need for security-driven product design, where security considerations guide the healthcare product's design choices and implementation.",...

40979439,Global reform population health management as stewarded by Higher Expert Medical Science Safety (HEMSS).,"As described in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on AI infrastructure, global human phenotype ontology (HPO) is a priority for the US and the UK. The UK NHS Act of 1946 and the Medicare and Medicaid Act of 1965 classify using genomics as primary care, supporting international HPO aims for Population Health Management (PHM). The Higher Expert Medical Science Safety (HEMSS) proposes the NHS England, Genomics, and Biobank agile group developers. The HEMSS strategy executes the PHM of the HPO through digital records, pilot citizen predictor pre-eXams, and precise eXam intercept classifications, continuously improving public safety. PHM reform includes biobank opportunities for Value-Based Care (VBC) stratifying genomic and socio-environmental factors that risk HPO in disease segmentation. The author evaluated a standard approach to PHM for HPO with mature and advanced interoperable standards. A reform toolkit aligns adversarial, neural, and transformer models for Generative AI by utilizing multimodal data nuanced for fairness in Quantum Intelligence. The recommendations include HEMSS steps from well-being evaluations to the PHM strategy for HPO in the UK-US. Concepts involve piloting the scaling up of neighborhood clinics and federal centers through reform classification. Plans for citizen privacy facilitate data use with access to reference biobanks, ensuring DNA democratization and national cybersecurity. The UK NHSE corporate governance and US federal authorities monitor and reform the Integrated Care Board assessments and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services surveys using agile methods. The UK-US MoU for AI safety is an international ideal for PHM, creating a safe space for HPO adherence to predictive and interceptive adoption for health and socioeconomic growth. HEMSS Agile Group Development impacts ethical and societal primary care debates. HEMSS discussions on global public health inclusiveness and national engagement aim to govern the classification phases for adherence. Therefore, debates on UK-US accreditation or regulation on the future of Artificial General Intelligence follow. The author concludes in support of the Population Health Management Expert Medical Science Safety Agile Group Development Program. The UK and US governments would benefit from this proposition, and international goals for well-being and socioeconomic growth would also be supported.",Frontiers in artificial intelligence,2025
40972627,Artificial intelligence and infectious disease diagnostics: state of the art and future perspectives.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping infectious disease diagnostics by supporting clinical decision making, optimising laboratory and clinical workflows, and enabling real-time disease surveillance. AI approaches improve pathogen detection, antimicrobial stewardship, and treatment monitoring, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. The role of AI in combating antimicrobial resistance is particularly significant, enabling rapid pathogen identification and personalised treatment. Despite progress over the past two decades, widespread AI adoption in infectious disease diagnostics faces challenges. In high-income countries, fragmented data ecosystems, incomplete datasets, and algorithmic bias hinder clinical integration. Meanwhile, low-income and middle-income countries contend with limited digital infrastructure, unstandardised data, and financial constraints, exacerbating disparities in diagnostic access. Further barriers include concerns over interoperability, data privacy, cybersecurity, and the regulation of AI implementation. This paper examines the role of AI in infectious disease diagnostics, highlighting both opportunities and limitations. It underscores the need for coordinated investments in digital infrastructure, harmonised data-sharing frameworks, and clinician engagement to support equitable, sustainable adoption. Addressing these challenges will enable health-care systems to harness the potential of AI to improve infectious disease detection, prevention, and management of infectious diseases, thereby strengthening global health resilience.",The Lancet.

40968934,Research on Lightweight Dynamic Security Protocol for Intelligent In-Vehicle CAN Bus.,"With the integration of an increasing number of outward-facing components in intelligent and connected vehicles, the open controller area network (CAN) bus environment faces increasingly severe security threats. However, existing security measures remain inadequate, and CAN bus messages lack effective security mechanisms and are vulnerable to malicious attacks. Although encryption algorithms can enhance system security, their high bandwidth consumption negatively impacts the real-time performance of intelligent and connected vehicles. Moreover, the message authentication mechanism of the CAN bus requires lengthy authentication codes, further exacerbating the bandwidth burden. To address these issues, we propose an improved dynamic compression algorithm that achieves higher compression rates and efficiency by optimizing header information processing during data reorganization. Additionally, we have proposed a novel dynamic key management approach, incorporating a dynamic key distribution mechanism, which effectively resolves the challenges associated with key management. Each Electronic Control Unit (ECU) node independently performs compression, encryption, and authentication while periodically updating its keys to enhance system security and strengthen defense capabilities. Experimental results show that the proposed dynamic compression algorithm improves the average compression rate by 2.24% and enhances compression time efficiency by 10% compared to existing solutions. The proposed security protocol effectively defends against four different types of attacks. In hardware tests, using an ECU operating at a frequency of 30 MHz, the computation time for the security algorithm on a single message was 0.85 ms, while at 400 MHz, the computation time was reduced to 0.064 ms. Additionally, for different vehicle models, the average CAN bus load rate was reduced by 8.28%. The proposed security mechanism ensures the security, real-time performance, and freshness of CAN bus messages while reducing bus load, providing a more efficient and reliable solution for the cybersecurity of intelligent and connected vehicles.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025

However, IoT security remains a significant challenge due to vulnerabilities related to data breaches, privacy concerns, cyber threats, and trust management issues. Addressing these risks requires advanced security mechanisms, with machine learning (ML) emerging as a powerful tool for anomaly detection, intrusion detection, and threat mitigation. This survey provides a comprehensive review of ML-driven IoT security solutions from 2020 to 2024, examining the effectiveness of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning approaches, as well as advanced techniques such as deep learning (DL), ensemble learning (EL), federated learning (FL), and transfer learning (TL). A systematic classification of ML techniques is presented based on their IoT security applications, along with a taxonomy of security threats and a critical evaluation of existing solutions in terms of scalability, computational efficiency, and privacy preservation. Additionally, this study identifies key limitations of current ML approaches, including high computational costs, adversarial vulnerabilities, and interpretability challenges, while outlining future research opportunities such as privacy-preserving ML, explainable AI, and edge-based security frameworks. By synthesizing insights from recent advancements, this paper provides a structured framework for developing robust, intelligent, and adaptive IoT security solutions. The findings aim to guide researchers and practitioners in designing next-generation cybersecurity models capable of effectively countering emerging threats in IoT ecosystems.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025
40955852,Impact of Cybersecurity Self-Efficacy on Digital Economic Behaviors Among Older Adults.,"Older adults often face challenges with digital economic engagement due to concerns about cybersecurity and low levels of digital literacy, particularly a lack of confidence in their cybersecurity skills. This study examined how security behavior self-efficacy influences the digital economic behaviors of older adults. We analyzed data from 1808 South Korean participants aged 65 and older using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The variables included digital economic behaviors, security behavior self-efficacy, mis-and disinformation self-efficacy, and privacy self-efficacy. The findings revealed that higher cybersecurity self-efficacy positively affected the digital economic behaviors of older adults. Additionally, security behavior self-efficacy was a significant predictor of both misinformation and disinformation self-efficacy as well as privacy self-efficacy. In turn, both mis-and disinformation self-efficacy and privacy self-efficacy positively influenced digital economic behaviors, with partial mediation effects identified. Overall, cybersecurity self-efficacy is essential for older adults' participation in the digital economy, impacting their engagement both directly and indirectly through improved awareness and privacy management. These findings highlight the need for targeted educational programs and policies aimed at enhancing digital literacy and building confidence in cybersecurity, ultimately promoting safe and effective digital participation among the elderly.","Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",2025

This dataset provides the results of a static analysis performed on system binary files extracted from multiple versions of the Windows operating system, accompanied by their similarity digests. An automated static analysis process was applied to all extracted binaries to decompose them into individual functions and capture detailed metadata for each of them. Specifically, similarity hashes (in particular, TLSH, ssdeep, and LZJD) were computed to enable forensic analysts to effectively assess artifact similarities. The dataset serves as an ""allow list"" of legitimate Windows artifacts, allowing forensic analysts to detect deviations from trusted binaries, verify system integrity, perform software audits, and improve malware detection efforts.

40955343,When the Internet Gets Under Our Skin: Reassessing Consumer Law and Policy in a Society of Cyborgs.,"In this article, the authors identify and explore the phenomenon of consumer cyborgification and ask what the legal and ethical implications of this emerging trend are. They consider whether fundamental legal principles, concepts, and assumptions in various EU acts and directives are adequate to address these challenges or whether these need to be reassessed in light of novel forms of vulnerability. They also ask what alternatives might be suggested. In the era of the consumer Internet of Things (IoT), consumer expectations of privacy, security, and durability are changing. While the consumer uses of the IoT often revolve around improving efficiency (e.g., of the body, the home, the car) and enhancing experiences through datafication of our bodies and environments and personalization of services and interfaces, the power of IoT companies to influence consumer behaviours and preferences is increasing in part because the hybridization of humans and machines. Cyborgification allows our behaviours to be individually and continuously monitored and nudged in real time. Our bodies and minds are reflected back at us through data, shaping the narratives we tell about ourselves and our surroundings, and this is creating new lifeworlds and shaping our preferences, roles, and identities. This presents novel benefits, as well as risks in the potential exploitation of novel vulnerabilities. With technology under the skin, both metaphorically (in relation to products that become a sensory accessory to the body and influence the perception and physical reality of one's body and lifeworld) and literally (in the form of microchips, cybernetic implants, and biometric sensors and actuators), cyborg consumers are more vulnerable to manipulative practices, unfair contractual terms, automated decision-making, and to privacy and security breaches. Cyborg consumers are therefore more susceptible to damage, financial and physical, caused by defective products, low-quality services, and lax cybersecurity. Law, policy, and practice must go further than merely enhancing transparency and consent processes and prohibit practices and business models that are premised on manipulating the need to anticipate and manage the working of technologies under the skin, i.e., that which undermines consumer and public interests systematically. The law needs to be agile and responsive to the changes the IoT has established in the consumer-producer relationship. Consumer laws, including the contractual/consenting process itself, must be reviewed and reimagined to ensure more robust protections.",Journal of consumer policy,2025
40951387,"Economic, ethical, and regulatory dimensions of artificial intelligence in healthcare: an integrative review.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare by improving diagnostic precision, streamlining clinical workflows, and reducing operational costs. Yet, its integration into real-world settings remains fraught with challenges-including economic uncertainty, ethical complexities, fragmented regulatory landscapes, and practical implementation barriers. A growing body of literature highlights that many of AI's purported benefits are derived from idealized models, often failing to reflect the nuances of clinical practice. This integrative review aims to critically evaluate the current evidence on the integration of artificial intelligence into healthcare, with a particular focus on its economic impact, ethical and regulatory challenges, and associated governance and implementation strategies. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Data extraction followed a structured, pre-tested template, and thematic synthesis was employed. Study quality was assessed using an integrated framework combining PRISMA, AMSTAR 2, and the Drummond checklist. Seventeen studies-including systematic reviews, scoping reviews, narrative syntheses, policy analyses, and quantitative case studies-met the inclusion criteria. Three core themes emerged from the analysis. First, while AI interventions-particularly in treatment optimization-are projected to generate significant cost savings and improve operational efficiency, most economic evaluations rely on theoretical models. Many lack transparency regarding key assumptions such as discount rates, sensitivity analyses, and real-world implementation costs, limiting their generalizability. Second, ethical and regulatory concerns persist, with widespread underrepresentation of marginalized populations in training datasets, limited safeguards for patient autonomy, and notable equity disparities across clinical domains. Regulatory frameworks remain fragmented globally, with marked variation in standards for cybersecurity, accountability, and innovation readiness. Third, effective governance and risk management are critical for ensuring safe and sustainable AI integration. Persistent implementation barriers-such as clinician trust deficits, cognitive overload, and data interoperability challenges-underscore the need for robust multidisciplinary collaboration. To address these challenges, we present the IA<sup>2</sup>TF Framework-a theoretical model pending empirical validation. It is built on five pillars: co-design and problem definition, data standardization, real-world performance monitoring, ethical and regulatory integration, and multidisciplinary governance. This framework offers an actionable roadmap for fostering equitable, trustworthy, and scalable AI deployment across healthcare systems. Maximizing the transformative potential of AI in healthcare will require rigorous economic evaluation, equity-driven design, harmonized global regulation, and inclusive implementation science. The IA<sup>2</sup>TF Framework provides a foundation for ethically grounded, patient-centered, and financially sustainable AI integration.",Frontiers in public health,2025
40949905,Smartwatches in childhood: a mixed blessing?-a scoping review.,"Smartwatches are commonly used within the community, especially amongst its younger population. These devices have a wide range of capabilities, including measuring the heart rate, generating electrocardiographic traces, and issuing alerts when 'abnormal' activity is detected. This information has potential benefits but also potential risks if the health-related measurements lead to inappropriate clinical interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the current literature on the prevalence, perception and interpretation of smartwatches that document and record cardiac information as it impacts on children, adolescents and their parents. We conducted a scoping review based on the principles of Arksey and O'Malley, which followed the scoping review checklist of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The selection criteria yielded 29 papers. They reported that smartwatch usage in children ranged from 15% to 40%, depending on the country of residence. The number of children presenting with smartwatch-based heart concerns had increased, with many false positives and few true arrhythmia diagnoses. Although there was good accuracy of heart rate measurements, there were poor automated algorithms for heart rhythm classification for the paediatric population. In addition, a few studies reported paediatric smartwatch user anxiety arising from the information generated by the devices. The wearing of smartwatches has increased in children and adolescents. While they are able to record heart rates and provide corresponding electrocardiographic tracings virtually continuously and non-invasively, misinterpretation of the data arising from poor algorithms have led to increased healthcare presentations, as well as child and/or parental concern. There remains a need for ongoing education to understand the variability of the heart rate, especially in children. Furthermore, better algorithms for the interpretation of the information gleaned are required for this relatively well young population, so as to allay the anxiety that may be experienced. The issues related to medicolegal liability, privacy and cybersecurity remain to be resolved.",Translational pediatrics,2025

40942943,EMBRAVE: EMBedded Remote Attestation and Verification framEwork.,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a growing area of interest with an increasing number of applications, including cyber-physical systems (CPS). Emerging threats in the IoT context make software integrity verification a key solution for checking that IoT platforms have not been tampered with so that they behave as expected. Trusted Computing techniques, in particular Remote Attestation (RA), can address this critical need. RA techniques allow a trusted third party (Verifier) to verify the software integrity of a remote platform (Attester). RA techniques rely on the presence of a secure element on the device that acts as a Root of Trust (RoT). Several specifications have been proposed to build RoTs, such as the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), the Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE), and the Measurement and Attestation RootS (MARS). IoT contexts are often characterized by a highly dynamic scenario where platforms are constantly joining and leaving networks. This condition can be challenging for RA techniques as they need to be aware of the nodes that make up the network. This paper presents the EMBedded Remote Attestation and Verification framEwork (EMBRAVE). It is a TPM-based RA framework designed to provide a dynamic and scalable solution for RA in IoT networks. To support dynamic networks, we designed and developed Join and Leave Protocols, permitting attestation of devices that are not directly under the control of the network owner. This paper discusses the design and open-source implementation of EMBRAVE and presents experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025
40942669,An Analysis and Simulation of Security Risks in Radar Networks from the Perspective of Cybersecurity.,"Radar networks, composed of multiple radar stations and a fusion center interconnected via communication technologies, are widely used in civil aviation and maritime operations. Ensuring the security of radar networks is crucial. While their strong anti-jamming capabilities make traditional electronic countermeasures less effective, the openness and vulnerability of their network architecture expose them to cybersecurity risks. Current research on radar network security risk analysis from a cybersecurity perspective remains insufficient, necessitating further study to provide theoretical support for defense strategies. Taking centralized radar networks as an example, this paper first analyzes their architecture and potential cybersecurity risks, identifying a threat where attackers could potentially execute false data injection attacks (FDIAs) against the fusion center via man-in-the-middle attacks (MITMAs). A threat model is then established, outlining possible attack procedures and methods, along with defensive recommendations and evaluation metrics. Furthermore, for scenarios involving single-link control without traffic increase, the impact of different false data construction methods is examined. Simulation experiments validate the findings, showing that the average position offset increases from 8.38 m to 78.35 m after false data injection. This result confirms significant security risks under such threats, providing a reference for future countermeasure research.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025
40932890,Federated quantum-inspired anomaly detection using collaborative neural clients.,"The fusion of deep-learning-based and federated methods has brought great progress in anomaly detection. Yet the systems of today still suffer from certain glaring issues. First, aggregation of data on a central entity poses dangerous privacy hazards. Second, such models could not scale and adapt to heterogeneous and distributed environments. Lastly, fine consideration has hardly been given to quantum-inspired computational paradigms that may promise to improve both speed and security of such systems. To fill in these gaps, this research proposes a completely novel quantum-inspired federated learning approach to anomaly detection that keeps data private and allows for further implementations of quantum computing applications. The proposed system works on a client-server architecture comprising multiple clients, which either run training of local feedforward neural networks on different private subsets of their data or choose to not participate during an iteration. Clients never pass raw data to the server but instead alternate by sending the server the parameters of the trained model. The server aggregates these local updates by the FedAvg algorithm and produces the global model. The present implementation focuses mainly on utilizing classical deep learning; however, the architecture is made flexible enough to intertwine smoothly with quantum machine-learning paradigms in the future, thus enabling quantum technological enhancement down the road without requiring the entire system to be rebuilt. The framework could produce up to 79% of anomalous detection accuracy. The system had effective learning across distributed clients whilst ensuring that no piece of private data was being shared or spilled (exposed) between clients. These results ensured that the framework maintained its performance while keeping its privacy intact, a very crucial consideration on which to ever really deploy such in sensitive areas. The approach allows privacy-preserving anomaly detection across multiple domains and serves as a framework for enlarging and scaling the system. Being quantum-inspired compatible allows for future-proofing and further expediting and enhancing security. The system, having the capability to securely work in a distributed manner, can, thus, be utilized in critical information domains like cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare, where privacy of data is deemed extremely important. This work, thereby, offers a useful federated learning approach towards anomaly detection while going a step further towards the incorporation of quantum computing into secure, distributed AI systems.",Frontiers in artificial intelligence,2025

40924531,A Distributed Projection Operator-Based Unknown Input Observer for Attack Estimation and Mitigation on DC Microgrids.,"Cyberattacks on transmitted signals are the most critical threats to modern microgrid (MG) systems and should be accurately addressed to ensure safe and reliable operation. This article investigates the cybersecurity of dc MGs against FDI attacks and develops a novel model-based observer system. The proposed projection operator (PO)-based UIO is uniquely designed to detect attacks on the transmitted data from other distributed generation units. For this purpose, a bank of PO observers is developed in each distributed generation unit to estimate all neighbor units' dynamic states. Cyberattack reconstruction compares the remotely observed state values with the measured ones. Afterwards, the detected attack signal values are utilized to restore the integrity of the compromised signals, effectively mitigating the harmful effects of cyberattacks. The most important feature of this scheme, which distinguishes it from similar methods, is that there is no need for a secure channel or additional information transfer in this method. Extensive real-time numerical simulations are performed to assess the practicality and efficiency of the proposed approach when subjected to various attack scenarios, demonstrating its advantages over other methods.",IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2025
40918075,The impact of data breach on IT investment at neighboring hospitals: Evidence from California Hospitals.,"This study investigates the effect of data breach incidents on IT investment at neighboring hospitals. Hospital data are collected from the California Department of Health Care Access and Information and matched with the breach archive provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights to construct a set of breached hospitals. Using a community detection algorithm, neighborhoods of hospitals are constructed to serve as the treatment group of breached hospitals against unaffected hospitals. To control for potential differences between affected and unaffected communities, hospitals are matched using propensity score matching. Subsequently, the effect of data breach incidents on IT investment at neighboring hospitals is estimated using a difference-in-differences model. Analysis of hospital financial data from 2011 to 2017 revealed that neighboring hospitals responded to hacking/IT data breaches with a statistically significant 51% increase (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in IT capital investment in the year following exposure to the breach event. This association was substantially magnified in hospitals with above-median net income, demonstrating a 163% (<i>p</i> < 0.01) increase in IT capital expenditure. However, hospitals with lower net income showed no significant change in IT capital investment. Notably, we observed no statistically significant changes in overall IT expenditure or IT labor costs across any hospital category. Geographically, hacking/IT incidents predominantly occurred in major urban areas where market concentration was lower (HHI of 1243 in treatment groups vs. 1961 in control groups). Data breaches involving hacking/IT incidents at a neighboring hospital could nudge a hospital toward increased IT capital investment. This may result from neighboring hospitals acknowledging the need to take preventive measures. Hospitals should be strategically encouraged to reinforce cybersecurity capacity to minimize loss from future attacks.",Digital health,2025

40913053,Enhancing cybersecurity in virtual power plants by detecting network based cyber attacks using an unsupervised autoencoder approach.,"The increasing adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) in energy systems has brought significant advancements but also heightened cyber security risks. Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), which aggregate distributed renewable energy resources into a single entity for participation in energy markets, are particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to their reliance on modern information and communication technologies. Cyber-attacks targeting devices, networks, or specific goals can compromise system integrity. Common attack types include Denial of Service (DoS), Man-in-the-Middle (MITM), and False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA).Among these threats, FDIA are especially concerning as they manipulate critical operational data, such as bid prices and energy quantities, to disrupt system reliability, market stability, and financial performance. This study proposes an unsupervised Autoencoder (AE) deep learning approach to detect FDIA in VPP systems. The methodology is validated on a 9-bus and IEEE-39 bus test system modeled in MATLAB Simulink, encompassing renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, and variable loads. Time-series data generated over 1,000 days is used for training, validation, and testing the AE model. The results demonstrate the model's ability to detect anomalies with high accuracy by analyzing reconstruction errors. By identifying false data, the approach ensures system reliability, protects against financial losses, and maintains energy market stability. This work highlights the importance of advanced machine learning techniques in enhancing cyber security for IoT-based energy systems and ensuring secure VPP operations.",Scientific reports,2025

Authorized users may intentionally or accidentally compromise data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This study assessed information security practices from the perspective of healthcare professionals in Spanish medical centers. A descriptive, analytical, cross-sectional study was conducted using a survey administered to 41 healthcare professionals with access to confidential data. The survey covered access control, encryption at rest and in transit, communication channels, and data usage control. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests, and Cramér's V were applied to identify significant associations. K-means clustering and Silhouette coefficient were used to define user profiles. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to visualize behavior patterns. A Random Forest model identified the most relevant predictive variables. Critical security gaps were detected, 31.7 % reported no control over data usage. Only 29.3 % encrypted data at rest and 36.6 % during transmission. Over 40 % used personal email or messaging apps to share sensitive data, and 97.6 % relied solely on passwords for authentication. These practices are inadequate to mitigate insider threats. There is an urgent need to strengthen insider data protection. Security strategies should be tailored to user risk profiles. Measures must include strong authentication, full encryption, and stricter control of data transmission to reduce exposure to insider threats (intentionally or unintentionally) in healthcare settings. Additionally, there is a need to promote continuous cybersecurity training.",International journal of medical informatics,2025
40906752,Multilayered SDN security with MAC authentication and GAN-based intrusion detection.,"Computer networks are highly vulnerable to cybersecurity intrusions. Likewise, software-defined networks (SDN), which enable 5G users to broadcast sensitive data, have become a primary target for vulnerability. To protect the network security against attacks, various security protocols, including authorization, the authentication process, and intrusion detection techniques, are essential. However, there are several intrusion detection strategies, but the most prevalent methods show low accuracy and high false positives. To overcome these problems, this research work presents a novel four-Q curve authentication system based on Media Access Control (MAC) addresses for a multilayered SDN intrusion detection system utilizing deep learning techniques to identify and prevent attacks. The Four-Q curve authentication system leverages elliptic curve cryptography, a high-performance algorithm that improves authentication security and computational efficiency. Initially, Four-Q curve authentication is performed, followed by univariate ensemble feature selection to select optimal switches. Then, the data collected through the switches are classified as normal, assault, and suspect packets based on the Dual Discriminator Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (DDcGAN) approach. Further, the optimization of DDcGAN is accomplished using the Sheep Flock Optimization Algorithm (SFOA), whereas suspicious packets are categorized using the Growing Self-Organizing Map (GSOM). The DDcGAN-based intrusion detection system outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, precision, F1 score, sensitivity, false-positive rate, power consumption, and network throughput. It achieved an accuracy of 98.29%, an F1 score of 0.975, and a precision of 95.8%. The system's true positive rate attained 99.04% at 50% malicious nodes, while the false alarm rate was as low as 2.05% under the same conditions. Moreover, the system exhibits 4.5% energy savings when compared to existing approaches.",PloS one,2025
40901898,Improving the accuracy of cybersecurity spam email detection using ensemble techniques: A stacking approach Machine learning for spam email detection.,"With the widespread adoption of internet technologies and email communication systems, the exponential growth in email usage has precipitated a corresponding surge in spam proliferation. These unsolicited messages not only consume users' valuable time through information overload but also pose significant cybersecurity threats through malware distribution and phishing schemes, thereby jeopardizing both digital security and user experience. This emerging challenge underscores the critical importance of developing effective spam detection mechanisms as a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity infrastructure. Through empirical analysis of machine learning (ML) performance on publicly available spam datasets, we established that algorithmic ensemble methods consistently outperform individual models in detection accuracy. We propose an optimized stacking ensemble framework that strategically combines predictions from four heterogeneous base models (NBC, k-NN, LR, XGBoost) through meta-learner integration. Our methodology incorporates grid search cross-validation with hyperparameter space optimization, enabling systematic identification of parameter configurations that maximize detection performance. The enhanced model was rigorously evaluated using comprehensive metrics including accuracy (99.79%), precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating statistically significant improvements over both baseline models and existing solutions documented in the literature.",PloS one,2025

40899549,Systematic Evaluation of Manufacturer Disclosure Statements for Medical Device Security (MDS2) to Strengthen Hospital OT Security Measures - Lessons Learned.,"The growing number of connected medical devices in hospitals poses serious operational technology (OT) security challenges. Effective countermeasures require a structured analysis of the communication interfaces and security configurations of individual devices. Although Manufacturer Disclosure Statements for Medical Device Security (MDS2, Version 2019) offer relevant information, they are rarely integrated into cybersecurity workflows. Existing studies are limited in scope and lack scalable methodologies for systematic evaluation. This study analyzed 209 MDS2 documents and 161 security white papers to extract structured information on ports, protocols, and protective measures. Over 52,000 question-answer pairs were converted into a machine-readable format using customized parsing and validation routines. The aim was to establish whether this dataset could inform risk assessments and future applications involving Large Language Models (LLMs). The analysis revealed 367 distinct ports, including common protocols such as HTTPS (443), DICOM (104), and RDP (3389), as well as vendor-specific proprietary ports. Approximately 40% of the devices used over 20 ports, indicating a broad attack surface. OCR errors and inconsistent formatting required manual corrections. A consolidated dataset was developed to support clustering, comparison across vendors and versions, and preparation for downstream LLM use, particularly via structured SBOM and configuration data. Although no model training was conducted, the structured dataset can support AI-based OT security workflows. The findings highlight the critical need for up-to-date, machine-readable manufacturer data in standardized formats and schemas. Such information could greatly enhance the automation, comparability, and scalability of hospital cybersecurity measures.",Studies in health technology and informatics,2025
40896838,Resilience in the Face of Disruption: Viewpoint on the CrowdStrike Incident in July 2024.,"In an era where health care is increasingly dependent on digital infrastructure, the resilience of health IT systems has become a cornerstone of patient safety and operational continuity. As cyber threats grow in frequency and sophistication, health care organizations have turned to advanced cybersecurity tools to safeguard their systems. Yet even the most robust defenses can falter. On July 19, 2024, a routine update from a widely used cybersecurity platform triggered a widespread IT disruption. A flawed sensor configuration led to 8647 ""blue screen of death"" (BSOD) events, with 729 devices requiring manual remediation. What unfolded was not just a technical crisis but a test of organizational agility, collaboration, and resilience. This viewpoint traces the response to that disruption, highlighting the pivotal role of clinical informaticists and the coordinated efforts that enabled a rapid recovery. From the formation of an incident response team to the triage and mitigation of impacted systems, the response was swift and strategic. Clinical informaticists emerged as key players, bridging the gap between technical teams and frontline care providers. They identified workflow disruptions, facilitated communication, and ensured that patient care remained as uninterrupted as possible. Despite the scale of the outage, operations continued with minimal disruption-thanks to early recognition, decisive action, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. This incident underscored the importance of a well-practiced response plan, clear communication channels, and the integration of clinical expertise in technical recovery efforts. As we reflect on this event, several lessons emerge: the need for continuous refinement of incident response strategies, the value of regular training exercises, and the critical role of clinical informatics in navigating digital crises. This paper calls for a renewed commitment to building resilient health IT ecosystems-ones that can withstand disruption and continue to support the delivery of safe, effective care.",JMIR medical informatics,2025
40896382,Electronic health record market consolidation and implications for cybersecurity.,"Over the past decade, the electronic health record (EHR) market has become increasingly consolidated, with the majority of care delivery organizations now using 1 of 2 vendors -Epic and Oracle Health. This consolidation creates a ""single-point-of-failure"" tail risk for cybersecurity: 1 successful attack could expose millions of patients' private data and could potentially impact documentation, billing, and clinical care across thousands of sites. Moreover, dependence on other technology vendors, such as shared cloud hosts, broadens the potential attack surface beyond vendors' core firewalls. Given that reversing consolidation is unlikely due to high EHR switching costs, it is critical that policymakers establish safeguards that ensure robust protections for patients' sensitive data. The Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy plays a critical role in mandating certain security features through the Certified Electronic Health Record Technology Program, and this role should be expanded to provide additional oversight, given the risks presented by the current market structure. Sustained investment in regulatory oversight and continued partnerships between policymakers, care delivery organizations, and EHR vendors are essential to contain the catastrophic risk involved from this ongoing market consolidation.",Health affairs scholar,2025
40894349,Towards Integrated and Quality-assured Health Service Delivery: Making a Case for Health Smart Card in the Philippines.,"In the Philippines, patients are constrained from accessing their own records, restricting their ability to freely choose who to seek care from. To address this, the study makes a case for the development of the health smart card in the Philippines, an integrative tool unique to each citizen carrying their lifetime medical record. The prototype is developed using no-code programming technology and validated through a series of focus group discussions and stakeholder consultations with patients (n=4), healthcare administrators (n=4), and hospital personnel (n=13). It was then revised based on the collected insights and recommendations. Findings report that the current facility-centric model utilizing paper records constrains patients' access to their records due to long wait times, slow turnaround periods, constant intra- and inter-hospital transfers, and even charging of fees to acquire a copy of their own data. The health smart card alternative was widely accepted by the participants, particularly for its contribution to increasing data accessibility, patient empowerment, and advancing patient data ownership. Nevertheless, several considerations for the upscale implementation of the health smart card emerged, including creating an interoperable environment through harmonizing standards and capacity-building programs, and ensuring data security through robust cybersecurity measures. Issues on scalability and funding of the project were also raised, centering on the critical role of the government in stepping up as regulator and potential funder. Concerns over potential abuse, dataveillance, and the digital divide are tackled, highlighting the need to account for socioeconomic factors to ensure that no one is left behind in the implementation. The study makes a case for the development and adoption of a health smart card to address the inaccessibility of records to patients. The study concludes by recommending the conduct of a pilot implementation to comprehensively demonstrate and analyze the features of the proposed scheme.",Acta medica Philippina,2025

40890265,M-estimation activation functions for high-performance extreme learning machine ensemble classification.,"Machine learning plays a pivotal role in addressing real-world challenges across domains such as cybersecurity, where AI-driven methods, especially in Software-Defined Networking, enhance traffic monitoring and anomaly detection. Contemporary networks often employ models like Random Forests, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines to identify threats early and reinforce security. Ensemble learning further improves predictive accuracy and stability, yet many frameworks falter when confronted with noisy or contaminated data. In this study, we propose a robust ensemble framework for Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) that integrates a family of redescending ψ-activation functions grounded in M-estimation theory. Each ψ-function yields a distinct base classifier, initialized with random weights, and the optimal hidden-node count is selected via grid search minimizing the Brier score. Rather than traditional voting, ensemble outputs are combined through a least-squares optimization, allowing precise parameter estimation and enhanced stability. We validate our method on five benchmark datasets, SatImage, Email-Spamdexing, Breast Cancer, Musk, and Iris, demonstrating consistently superior accuracy and reduced variance compared to existing ELM ensembles. Rigorous statistical testing (Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's post-hoc comparisons) confirms these gains. Our results show that embedding robust M-estimator-based activations within a controlled ensemble yields marked improvements in generalization, predictive precision, and resilience to data irregularities, offering a significant advancement in the design of efficient neural classifiers.",Scientific reports,2025

40877373,Cyberattack event and arguments extraction based on feature interaction and few-shot learning.,"Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) serves as a crucial indicator of cybersecurity events, providing critical evidence for analyzing cyberattacks and vulnerabilities. While existing deep learning approaches have shown value in processing urgent CTI data, accurately extracting cybersecurity event types and their associated arguments remains challenging due to CTI's inherent complexity and data scarcity. Moreover, the lack of a large-scale annotated corpus in the cybersecurity domain prevents direct application of large language models (LLMs) to surpass the current methods' performance. To enhance CTI information extraction efficiency, we propose the Cyber Attack Feature Interaction Information Extraction (CAFIIE) method. Our investigation reveals prevalent latent deep features in CTI threat entity interactions. Consequently, we implement multi-layer shallow feature interactions to capture these latent characteristics of threat entities and their relations. The CAFIIE model is further fine-tuned through few-shot learning to improve CTI feature utilization efficiency, making it particularly suitable for data-limited cybersecurity scenarios. Through experiments on three public and one private datasets, the CAFIIE method demonstrates superior accuracy and F1-score performance compared to existing baseline methods.",Scientific reports,2025

40868340,FADEL: Ensemble Learning Enhanced by Feature Augmentation and Discretization.,"In recent years, data augmentation techniques have become the predominant approach for addressing highly imbalanced classification problems in machine learning. Algorithms such as the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) have proven effective in synthesizing minority class samples. However, these methods often introduce distributional bias and noise, potentially leading to model overfitting, reduced predictive performance, increased computational costs, and elevated cybersecurity risks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel architecture, FADEL, which integrates feature-type awareness with a supervised discretization strategy. FADEL introduces a unique feature augmentation ensemble framework that preserves the original data distribution by concurrently processing continuous and discretized features. It dynamically routes these feature sets to their most compatible base models, thereby improving minority class recognition without the need for data-level balancing or augmentation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that FADEL, solely leveraging feature augmentation without any data augmentation, achieves a recall of 90.8% and a G-mean of 94.5% on the internal test set from Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. On the external validation set from Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital, it maintains a recall of 91.9% and a G-mean of 86.7%. These results outperform conventional ensemble methods trained on CTGAN-balanced datasets, confirming the superior stability, computational efficiency, and cross-institutional generalizability of the FADEL architecture. Altogether, FADEL uses feature augmentation to offer a robust and practical solution to extreme class imbalance, outperforming mainstream data augmentation-based approaches.","Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",2025

40847039,Optimizing IoT intrusion detection with cosine similarity based dataset balancing and hybrid deep learning.,"With IoT networks expected to exceed 29 billion connected devices by 2030, the risk of cyberattacks has never been higher. As more devices come online, the attack surface for hackers continues to expand, making cybersecurity a pressing concern. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for identifying and mitigating these threats in real-time. However, a significant challenge IDS faces is dealing with imbalanced datasets, where attack instances are significantly underrepresented compared to normal traffic. Training models on such skewed data leads to a bias toward majority-class patterns, reducing their ability to detect intrusions effectively. To address this issue, this work introduces CSMCR (Cosine Similarity-based Majority Class Reduction), a novel technique that selectively removes redundant majority-class samples while preserving dataset integrity. Unlike traditional approaches like SMOTE (oversampling) or random undersampling, CSMCR ensures that the retained majority instances remain diverse by analyzing feature-wise similarity. This prevents unnecessary data duplication and minimizes information loss. Additionally, we developed a hybrid deep learning model integrating RegNet and FBNet architectures to enhance feature extraction and classification performance. Experimental results on multiple IDS datasets confirm that balancing the dataset to a 1:1 ratio optimally prevents overfitting and improves model interpretability. The proposed model achieved an F1-score of 0.9758 on RT-IoT2022 and 0.9275 on UNSW Bot-IoT, outperforming SMOTE-based methods in accuracy and computational efficiency. Notably, CSMCR reduced training time by 53% compared to conventional oversampling techniques. Incremental training evaluations reveal that bias formation reduces performance beyond a 1:2 majority-to-minority ratio. These findings establish CSMCR as a robust, scalable, and computationally efficient IDS balancing strategy tailored for IoT network security.",Scientific reports,2025

40838797,Sociotechnical Cybersecurity Framework for Securing Health Care from Vulnerabilities and Cyberattacks: Scoping Review.,"The vulnerability of health care systems to cyberattacks and breaches of health information is on the rise around the world. Considering the increasing rate of reported cyber incidents and the risks they pose to patient safety, privacy, and financial losses, there is need to examine the way cybersecurity is conceptualized in health care organizations, taking into account technology, processes, and the humans. This study examined the dynamics of the factors of vulnerabilities and cyberattacks in the context of sociotechnical systems theory underlying the relationships among humans, technology, and processes. It developed a conceptual sociotechnical cybersecurity framework for preventing vulnerabilities and responding to cyberattacks and threats in health care systems. A scoping review was conducted to search extant literature in three databases-Web of Science, PubMed (Medline), and Scopus. A total of 1375 articles from the period of 2012-2024 were retrieved, 76 of which in the domain of health care and cybersecurity were reviewed and analyzed. Original research and review articles were included. Only published English-language articles were included to focus on contemporary issues, challenges, and solutions. Relevant information from the included sources was charted and summarized. The study characteristics were extracted from the included articles, and the evidence was synthesized using thematic analysis. Of the 1375 articles identified, 76 (5.5%) met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that the factors of vulnerabilities to cyberattacks comprise 12 subfactors in health care systems. With regard to technology-related factors of vulnerabilities, most studies described the complex system design and usability (16/76, 21%) and integration of new technology (15/76, 20%) as challenges in health care systems. With regard to human-related factors, most studies described a shortage of skilled professionals and limited budgets as contributing to poor cybersecurity management. The study found that processes involved both technology and humans relative to the unit factors of vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. There was a sociotechnical interplay across the factors of vulnerabilities. The concept of sociotechnical cybersecurity offers a comprehensive and explicit perspective on the sociotechnical underpinning and joint optimization required to advance cybersecurity toward achieving sustainable health care systems. The conceptual framework of sociotechnical cybersecurity provides a contemporary foundation and deep insight for identifying and preventing vulnerabilities and responding to cyberattacks in health care systems. The framework is important due to its suitability, applicability, and customizability for dynamic and complex health care systems. The study also provides compliance standards for applying the proposed conceptual framework to guide health care organizations in cybersecurity practices. The study of cybersecurity through the sociotechnical lens in the health care domain is limited. Further studies are needed on cybersecurity incident management. Health care organizations should leverage the strength of cybersecurity through the implementation of risk assessment and incident response plans.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025
40833550,"Navigating Medical Device Safety: Current Status, Challenges, and Future Regulatory Directions.","Medical devices are indispensable in modern healthcare. They enable the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases while enhancing patient outcomes. However, the increasing complexity of these devices, particularly those incorporating advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) introduces new challenges to their safe use. The vulnerabilities of medical devices can lead to adverse events ranging from minor complications to severe injuries or fatalities, and there is an increasing health risk to those devices that are interconnected to electronic health management systems and internet protocols. Despite efforts by regulatory authorities such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and Health Canada, disparities in reporting systems and monitoring practices persist globally, hindering effective safety oversight. This paper explores the current landscape of medical device safety, focusing on regulatory frameworks, reporting systems, and the challenges posed by fragmented data collection and underreporting. It highlights the critical role of postmarket surveillance (PMS) in identifying risks and ensuring device performance in real-world settings. The integration of emerging technologies, such as AI for predictive safety and blockchain for traceability, offers promising solutions to enhance monitoring and mitigate risks early in the device lifecycle. In addition, the paper examines harmonization efforts led by organizations such as The International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF), the International Society of Pharmacovigilance (ISoP) and the World Health Organazition (WHO), which aim to standardize reporting practices and improve global collaboration. Key recommendations include leveraging real-world data, enhancing cybersecurity measures, and fostering international cooperation to streamline regulatory processes.

However, owing to the constraints of limited resources and computation abilities, IoT networks are subject to different cyber-attacks. Incorporating IDS into the cybersecurity-driven IIoT process contains cautious deployment, planning, and progressing management. Cybersecurity is crucial for the protection of sensitive data, safeguarding the privacy of users, and securing important substructures from malicious activities attempting unauthorized access or triggering interferences. Cyberattack detection performs a vital role in this defense scheme, employing advanced technologies like deep learning (DL) for analysing digital activities in real time. With the help of recognizing and responding to possible cyber-attacks quickly, cyberattack detection not only mitigates risks but reinforces the overall flexibility of the digital ecosystem against developing security challenges. This study presents a League Championship Algorithm Feature Selection with Optimal Deep Learning based Cyberattack Detection (CLAFS-ODLCD) technique for securing the digital ecosystem. The CLAFS-ODLCD technique focuses on the recognition and classification of cyberattacks in the IoT infrastructure. To achieve this, the CLAFS-ODLCD method utilizes the linear scaling normalization (LSN) approach for data pre-processing. Furthermore, the CLAFS-ODLCD method employs the CLAFS approach to choose optimal feature subset. Moreover, the detection and classification of the cyberattacks are accomplished by implementing the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) approach. Finally, the hunger games search (HGS) optimizer is employed for optimum hyperparameter selection. The empirical analysis of the CLAFS-ODLCD method is examined under the WSN-DS dataset.

40830163,Applying the defense model to strengthen information security with artificial intelligence in computer networks of the financial services sector.,"The increasing digitization of the Financial Services Sector (FSS) has significantly improved operational efficiency but has also exposed institutions to sophisticated Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), zero-day exploits, and high-volume Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), including signature-based and anomaly-based approaches, suffer from high False Positive Rates (FPR) and lack the adaptability required for modern threat landscapes. This study aims to develop and evaluate an Artificial Intelligence-Enhanced Defense-in-Depth (AI-E-DiD) designed to provide real-time, adaptive, and scalable cybersecurity prevention for financial networks. The proposed model integrates a hybrid Generative Adversarial Network and Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoder (GAN-LSTM-AE) for intelligent anomaly detection, an Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) for data integrity and confidentiality, and an AI-Enhanced Intrusion Prevention System (AI-E-IPS) for dynamic threat mitigation. Empirical evaluation using the NSL-KDD and CICIDS-2017 datasets demonstrates high detection accuracy (95.6% for DoS and 94.2% for DDoS), low response times (< 0.25 s), and robust performance under varying user loads, attack types, and data sizes. The NS-3 results show that AI-DiD outperforms conventional IDS and traditional DiD in terms of Detection Rate (DR), Computational Overhead (CO), Network Throughput (NT), and operational scalability. These findings highlight the model's probable for deployment in high-stakes financial environments requiring resilient and intelligent cybersecurity infrastructure.",Scientific reports,2025
40830149,Advancements in cyberthreat intelligence through resource exhaustion attack detection using hybrid deep learning with heuristic search algorithms.,"The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is uncontrollable and appears in different patterns and shapes; accordingly, it is not easily detected and solved with preceding solutions. A DDoS attack is the most serious threat on the Internet. These attacks became a preferred weapon for cyber extortionists, terrorists, and hackers. These attacks can quickly undermine a target, producing massive revenue loss. Classification methods are applied in numerous investigations and have been used to identify and resolve DDoS attacks. Detection of DDoS attacks is problematic in terms of identifying and mitigating them. However, it is valuable as these attacks may lead to big problems. Various methods are presented for attack detection and prevention. However, artificial intelligence (AI)-based Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methodologies are highly effective for detecting DDoS attacks in cybersecurity. This paper proposes a Cybersecurity-Resource Exhaustion Attack Using Hybrid Deep Learning Model and Metaheuristic Optimizer Algorithms (CREA-HDLMOA) technique. The primary goal of the CREA-HDLMOA technique is to advance an effective method for DDoS attack detection using advanced optimization algorithms. Initially, the data normalization stage leverages linear scaling normalization (LSN) for converting input data into a beneficial format. Furthermore, the feature selection process uses the RIME optimization algorithm (ROA) model to select the most relevant features from the data. In addition, the hybrid of long short-term memory and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (LSTM + Bi-GRU) technique is employed for the DDoS attack classification process. Finally, the modernized pufferfish optimization algorithm (MPOA)-based hyperparameter selection process is performed to optimize the classification results of the LSTM + BiGRU technique. An extensive simulation is performed to validate the performance of the CREA-HDLMOA method under CIC-IDS2017 and Edge-IIoT datasets. The experimental validation of the CREA-HDLMOA method portrayed a superior accuracy value of 99.31% and 99.36% under dual datasets over existing approaches.",Scientific reports,2025
40825801,Scalable architecture for autonomous malware detection and defense in software-defined networks using federated learning approaches.,"This paper proposes a scalable and autonomous malware detection and defence architecture in software-defined networks (SDNs) that employs federated learning (FL). This architecture combines SDN's centralized management of potentially significant data streams with FL's decentralized, privacy-preserving learning capabilities in a distributed manner adaptable to varying time and space constraints. This enables a flexible, adaptive design and prevention approach in large-scale, heterogeneous networks. Using balanced datasets, we observed detection rates of up to 96% for controlled DDoS and Botnet attacks. However, in more realistic simulations that utilized diverse, real-world imbalanced datasets (such as CICIDS 2017 and UNSW-NB15) and complex scenarios like data exfiltration, the performance dropped to an overall accuracy of 59.50%. This reflects the challenges encountered in real-world deployments. We analyzed performance metrics such as detection accuracy, latency (less than 1 s), throughput recovery (from 300 to 500 Mbps), and communication overhead comparatively. Our architecture minimizes privacy risks by ensuring that raw data never leaves the device; only model updates are shared for aggregation at the global level. While it effectively detects high-impact incursions, there is room for improvement in identifying more subtle threats, which can be addressed with enriched datasets and improved feature engineering. This work offers a robust, privacy-preserving framework for deploying scalable and intelligent malware detection in contemporary network infrastructures.",Scientific reports,2025

40807889,Intrusion Detection and Real-Time Adaptive Security in Medical IoT Using a Cyber-Physical System Design.,"The increasing reliance on Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) devices introduces critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities, necessitating advanced, adaptive defense mechanisms. Recent cyber incidents-such as compromised critical care systems, modified therapeutic device outputs, and fraudulent clinical data inputs-demonstrate that these threats now directly impact life-critical aspects of patient security.

40807886,TwinFedPot: Honeypot Intelligence Distillation into Digital Twin for Persistent Smart Traffic Security.,"The integration of digital twins (DTs) with intelligent traffic systems (ITSs) holds strong potential for improving real-time management in smart cities. However, securing digital twins remains a significant challenge due to the dynamic and adversarial nature of cyber-physical environments. In this work, we propose TwinFedPot, an innovative digital twin-based security architecture that combines honeypot-driven data collection with Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) for robust and adaptive cyber threat detection without requiring prior sampling. The framework leverages Inverse Federated Distillation (IFD) to train the DT server, where edge-deployed honeypots generate semantic predictions of anomalous behavior and upload soft logits instead of raw data. Unlike conventional federated approaches, TwinFedPot reverses the typical knowledge flow by distilling collective intelligence from the honeypots into a central teacher model hosted on the DT. This inversion allows the system to learn generalized attack patterns using only limited data, while preserving privacy and enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and F1-score, establishing TwinFedPot as a scalable and effective defense solution for smart traffic infrastructures.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025
40807787,A Lightweight Intrusion Detection System with Dynamic Feature Fusion Federated Learning for Vehicular Network Security.,"The rapid integration of complex sensors and electronic control units (ECUs) in autonomous vehicles significantly increases cybersecurity risks in vehicular networks. Although the Controller Area Network (CAN) is efficient, it lacks inherent security mechanisms and is vulnerable to various network attacks. The traditional Intrusion Detection System (IDS) makes it difficult to effectively deal with the dynamics and complexity of emerging threats. To solve these problems, a lightweight vehicular network intrusion detection framework based on Dynamic Feature Fusion Federated Learning (DFF-FL) is proposed. The proposed framework employs a two-stream architecture, including a transformer-augmented autoencoder for abstract feature extraction and a lightweight CNN-LSTM-Attention model for preserving temporal and local patterns. Compared with the traditional theoretical framework of the federated learning, DFF-FL first dynamically fuses the deep feature representation of each node through the transformer attention module to realize the fine-grained cross-node feature interaction in a heterogeneous data environment, thereby eliminating the performance degradation caused by the difference in feature distribution. Secondly, based on the final loss LAEX,X^ index of each node, an adaptive weight adjustment mechanism is used to make the nodes with excellent performance dominate the global model update, which significantly improves robustness against complex attacks. Experimental evaluation on the CAN-Hacking dataset shows that the proposed intrusion detection system achieves more than 99% F1 score with only 1.11 MB of memory and 81,863 trainable parameters, while maintaining low computational overheads and ensuring data privacy, which is very suitable for edge device deployment.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025

Visual malware classification, which transforms malware binaries into grayscale images, has emerged as a promising alternative for recognizing patterns in malicious code. This study presents a hybrid deep learning architecture that combines the local feature extraction capabilities of ConvNeXt-Tiny (a CNN-based model) with the global context modeling of the Swin Transformer. The proposed model is evaluated using three benchmark datasets-Malimg, MaleVis, VirusMNIST-encompassing 61 malware classes. Experimental results show that the hybrid model achieved a validation accuracy of 94.04%, outperforming both the ConvNeXt-Tiny-only model (92.45%) and the Swin Transformer-only model (90.44%). Additionally, we extended our validation dataset to two more datasets-Maldeb and Dumpware-10-to strengthen the empirical foundation of our work. The proposed hybrid model achieved competitive accuracy on both, with 98% on Maldeb and 97% on Dumpware-10. To enhance model interpretability, we employed Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which visualizes the learned representations and reveals the complementary nature of CNN and Transformer modules. The hybrid architecture, combined with explainable AI, offers an effective and interpretable approach for malware classification, facilitating better understanding and trust in automated detection systems. In addition, a real-time deployment scenario is demonstrated to validate the model's practical applicability in dynamic environments.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025

40802372,A Sociotechnical Approach to Bring-Your-Own-Device Security in Hospitals: Development and Pilot Testing of a Maturity Model Using Mixed Methods Action Research.,"Bring your own device (BYOD) adoption in health care improves clinician productivity, but introduces cybersecurity risks due to weak security controls, human error, and policy circumvention. Existing security frameworks and models are technocentric, while overlooking sociotechnical factors such as clinician behavior, workflow integration, and organizational culture. This misalignment reduces their effectiveness in health care settings. In addition, hospitals vary in structure, resources, and BYOD use, necessitating a flexible yet structured approach to assess security maturity and prioritize improvements, which is lacking in existing models. This study aims to develop and pilot a hospital BYOD security maturity model that integrates technical, policy, and human factors for a structured assessment and improvement of BYOD security in health care. This study used mixed methods action research to design and pilot a hospital BYOD security maturity model. Surveys and interviews with IT managers and clinicians shaped the model, which was trialed at a public metropolitan hospital in Victoria, Australia. Participants completed a maturity assessment and joined a 90‑minute co‑design workshop that prioritized 6 key domains and proposed improvements. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis guided refinements to improve clarity and usability. The model was initially developed with 22 domains across 3 key dimensions: technology, policy, and people, each structured across 5 maturity levels to support systematic progression in hospital BYOD security. On the basis of participant feedback during the refinement process, 2 training-related domains were merged, resulting in a final model with 21 domains. The technology dimension includes domains such as identity, access, and authentication management; device security; and clinical communication, ensuring technical controls align with hospital policies and workflows. The policy dimension focuses on governance, covering areas such as BYOD strategy, regulatory compliance, and incident response, to establish clear security guidelines and enforcement mechanisms. The people dimension addresses human factors, including security awareness training, stakeholder involvement, and security culture, fostering staff engagement and adherence to security protocols. A maturity assessment survey conducted at a public metropolitan hospital in Victoria, Australia, revealed an overall maturity level of 2.04. Key areas for improvement included identity and access management, clinical communication security, and governance transparency. A 90-minute co-design workshop identified challenges and proposed solutions for the top 6 priority domains. Recommendations included implementing single sign-on, defining a formal BYOD strategy, enhancing secure communication tools, and improving stakeholder engagement. The model can serve as a valuable tool for hospitals and policy makers, offering actionable recommendations to strengthen BYOD security. The pilot implementation demonstrated its practical applicability, helping the hospital identify security gaps and develop a road map for structured enhancements. Further validation across diverse health care settings will enhance its adaptability and long-term impact.",JMIR human factors,2025

40790073,Soft actor-critic algorithm and improved GNN model in secure access control of disaggregated optical networks.,"To address the challenges of coordinated defense amid dynamic topology evolution and multidimensional security threats in decomposed optical networks, this study introduces the Graph-Entangled Security Actor-Critic (GESAC) model. GESAC is built on spatiotemporal modeling of evolving topologies and leverages a cross-layer spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture causal dependencies between optical path switching and access requests. Additionally, it enables adaptive delineation of security boundaries across multiple domains through federated representation learning. Within this framework, the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm is employed to construct a policy optimization mechanism. By integrating entropy-guided multi-objective reinforcement learning, GESAC maps encoded network states to access control strategies, jointly optimizing for security, service quality, and system resilience. Experimental validation is conducted on a heterogeneous dataset comprising Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) topology data, Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection Systems (CIC-IDS) access logs, and International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector threat characteristics. The dataset encompasses 12 attack scenarios, 57,000 dynamic topology sequences, and 2.8 million cross-domain authentication events. Key findings include: (1) Threat Detection: GESAC achieves an F1-score of 0.915-0.931 in identifying physical-layer attacks such as wavelength eavesdropping and cross-domain privilege escalation, with a false positive rate as low as 0.7%. (2) Resource Optimization: Compared to greedy strategies, GESAC improves wavelength utilization variance by up to 58.9% and reduces end-to-end latency standard deviation by up to 57.7% under high-load conditions. (3) Policy Robustness: In scenarios involving topological mutations, the model increases Pareto frontier coverage by over 100% and reduces policy entropy decay rate by more than 65%, indicating strong robustness. (4) Scalability: At a scale of 100,000 network nodes, GESAC achieves a single-step decision latency of just 25.6µs and significantly reduces communication overhead, demonstrating excellent scalability. GESAC is designed to overcome the limitations of static security policies in the face of dynamic decomposition and large-scale attacks in optical networks.

Data was gathered using PyShark and organized into multiple CSV files. To ensure high data quality, we performed pre-processing steps, such as outlier removal, normalization, standardization, and class balance. Several processed forms of data (e.g., raw, cleaned, normalized, standardized), along with detailed metadata are also provided for being used, for instance, to develop and validate AI-driven intrusion detection models.",Data in brief,2025

40773479,GNN-RMNet: Leveraging graph neural networks and GPS analytics for driver behavior and route optimization in logistics.,"Logistics networks are becoming increasingly complex and rely more heavily on real-time vehicle data, necessitating intelligent systems to monitor driver behavior and identify route anomalies. Traditional techniques struggle to capture the dynamic spatiotemporal relationships that define driver actions, route deviations, and operational inefficiencies in big fleets. This paper introduces GNN-RMNet, a hybrid deep learning system that combines GNN, ResNet, and MobileNet for interpretable, scalable, and efficient driver behavior profiling and route anomaly detection. GNN-RMNet utilizes spatiotemporal GPS trajectories and vehicle sensor streams to learn contextual and relational patterns from structured driving data in real time, thereby identifying dangerous driving and route violations. On a real-world GPS-vehicle sensor dataset, the proposed model achieves 98% accuracy, 97% recall, an F1-score of 97.5%, and domain-specific measures like Anomaly Detection Precision (96%) and Route Deviation Sensitivity (95%). Modular design offloads ResNet-GNN analytics to edge nodes while preserving MobileNet components for on-vehicle inference, resulting in reduced inference latency (32 ms). Comparing GNN-RMNet against baseline, ensemble, and hybrid models shows its accuracy, efficiency, and generalization advantages. Computational feasibility, anomaly scoring interpretability, and future deployment concerns, including cybersecurity, data privacy, and multimodal sensor integration, are all covered. For real-time fleet safety management and secure, intelligent, and context-aware logistics, GNN-RMNet seems promising. The framework incorporates multimodal, privacy-aware, and scalable driver analytics, enabling its use in intelligent transportation systems and urban logistics infrastructures.",PloS one,2025

Clinical laboratories, relying heavily on data-intensive systems, are particularly vulnerable to disruptions when hospital information systems are compromised. We conducted a single-center retrospective case study of a major cyberattack affecting the laboratory services at Notre Dame des Secours-UH in Lebanon. Operational data, incident reports, and recovery timelines were reviewed to characterize the attack's impact on laboratory operations and the resilience measures implemented. The cyberattack led to an immediate shutdown of laboratory information systems and automation, necessitating a shift to paper-based and manual processes. Key emergency protocols were activated within hours, including manual test ordering, handwritten result transcription with double verification, and specialized staff-controlled release of blood products. Critical services were maintained, but routine testing and volumes dropped sharply in the first week. A stepwise recovery ensued: by day 3 a limited laboratory information systems functionality was restored on a local network, by day 10 most laboratory services resumed albeit with workflow adjustments, and normal operations were largely re-established within two months. Our case points out to the operational resilience of a clinical laboratory during a prolonged cyber crisis. Effective crisis management, including timely incident response planning, staff adaptability, and emergency procedures, improved patient care in such a dreaded organizational situation and allowed for the return to normal workflow of the clinical laboratory.",Annales de biologie clinique,2025

40764727,An effectiveness of deep learning with fox optimizer-based feature selection model for securing cyberattack detection in IoT environments.,"The fast development of Internet of Things (IoT) tools in smart cities has presented many advantages, improving sustainability, automation, and urban efficiency. Still, these interlinked systems further pose critical cybersecurity difficulties, including cyberattacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access that may compromise essential frameworks. Usually, cybersecurity is considered a group of processes and technologies intended to safeguard networks, computers, data, and programs against malicious attacks, harm, activities, or unauthorized access. IoT cybersecurity targets to minimize cybersecurity threats for users and organizations regarding the safety of IoT assets and confidentiality. Novel cybersecurity technologies are continually developing and give opportunities and challenges to IoT cybersecurity organizations. Deep learning (DL) is one of the main technologies of today's smart cybersecurity policies or systems for functioning intelligently. This paper presents a Fox Optimizer-Based Feature Selection with Deep Learning for Securing Cyberattack Detection (FOFSDL-SCD) model. This paper aims to analyze cybersecurity-driven approaches for enhancing IoT networks' resilience and threat detection capabilities using advanced techniques. Initially, the data pre-processing stage utilizes the min-max normalization method to transform the input data into a beneficial system. Furthermore, the FOFSDL-SCD model utilizes the Fox optimizer algorithm (FOA) method for the feature selection process to select the most significant features from the dataset. Moreover, the temporal convolutional network (TCN) model is employed for classification. Finally, the dung beetle optimization (DBO)-based hyperparameter selection method is performed to improve the classification outcomes of the TCN model. The performance validation of the FOFSDL-SCD approach is examined under the Edge-IIoT dataset. The comparison study of the FOFSDL-SCD approach demonstrated a superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score of 99.38%, 96.27%, 96.26%, and 96.27% over existing models.",Scientific reports,2025
40764628,Daily insider threat detection with hybrid TCN transformer architecture.,"Internal threats are becoming more common in today's cybersecurity landscape. This is mainly because internal personnel often have privileged access, which can be exploited for malicious purposes. Traditional detection methods frequently fail due to data imbalance and the difficulty of detecting hidden malicious activities, especially when attackers conceal their intentions over extended periods. Most existing internal threat detection systems are designed to identify malicious users after they have acted. They model the behavior of normal employees to spot anomalies. However, detection should shift from targeting users to focusing on discrete work sessions. Relying on post hoc identification is unacceptable for businesses and organizations, as it detects malicious users only after completing their activities and leaving. Detecting threats based on daily sessions has two main advantages: it enables timely intervention before damage escalates and captures context-relevant risk factors. Our research introduces a novel detection framework for single-day employee behavior detection to address these issues. This framework combines the strengths of Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) and the Transformer architecture. The integrated model uses sliding window technology to segment user logs into time series for model input. The TCN component employs causal and dilated convolutions to maintain temporal order and expand the receptive field, enhancing the detection of long-term patterns. The Transformer models global dependencies in sequences, improving the detection of complex long-term behaviors. The model detects anomalies at each time step and achieves a recall rate of [Formula: see text] with a sequence length of 30 days. Experimental results show that this method can accurately detect malicious behavior daily, promptly identify such actions, and effectively mitigate internal threats in complex environments.",Scientific reports,2025
40762517,Untangling the Web of Deceit: Examining Shared User Susceptibility Across Five Types of Digital Deceptions.,"ObjectiveTo examine how domain-switching and user characteristics may predict broad susceptibility to digital deception.BackgroundDespite successful automated filtering techniques, humans remain vulnerable to fraud, losing billions of dollars annually. Many scams are delivered by digitally mediated methods, such as phishing emails or fake social media accounts. However, research typically explores susceptibility to these deceptions independently, making it difficult to draw broad conclusions regarding susceptibility to digital deception.MethodWe recruited a representative sample to investigate how susceptibility to deception may vary across digital domains, particularly when switching between domains (i.e., domain-switching). Participants classified stimuli from five different digital domains (i.e., emails, text messages, news headlines, social media accounts, and voicemails), either randomly (i.e., domain-switching) or in separate blocks, and completed measures of cognitive reflection and digital literacy.ResultsThe results suggest that when users struggle to discriminate between deceptive and legitimate stimuli in one digital deception domain, they are likely to struggle in others. Additionally, the results suggest that while cognitive reflection and digital literacy may help insulate users from deception, domain-switching may generally hinder user performance (i.e., slower responses).ConclusionOverall, individuals appear to be consistently vulnerable to deception across digital domains and this vulnerability can be exacerbated by certain task factors (e.g., domain-switching) and user characteristics (e.g., cognitive reflection and digital literacy).ApplicationTo develop more efficacious interventions that enhance user resiliency, research should consider broad training that incorporates correlates of susceptibility (e.g., cognitive reflection and digital literacy), and more realistic task settings (e.g., domain-switching).",Human factors,2025

40759336,Artificial intelligence and infectious diseases: Scope and perspectives.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to permeate every facet of infectious disease practice-from prevention and public health surveillance to epidemic management and bedside care. Routine care data (laboratory results, medication orders, progress notes) and research-generated datasets now fuel state-of-the-art machine-learning (ML) pipelines that sharpen diagnosis, prognosis, antimicrobial stewardship, and, by combining both sources, accelerate drug discovery. In diagnostics, deep networks that now flag pneumonia or tuberculosis on chest images are increasingly able to identify-and localize-virtually more infectious processes throughout the body, while simultaneously predicting pathogen identity and antimicrobial resistance from routine microbiology. Prognostic models trained on Electronic Health Records surpass traditional scores in anticipating clinical deterioration or postoperative sepsis, enabling earlier targeted interventions. Predictive analytics can also personalize antimicrobial dosing by fusing real-time drug-monitoring data. Large language models (LLMs) build upon these advances by transforming unstructured clinical narratives into structured phenotypes suitable for predictive modeling, automatically summarizing patient encounters, generating synthetic cohorts for rare conditions, and providing real-time conversational decision support at the patient's bedside. Despite rapid progress, real-world deployment faces hurdles: high computational and licensing costs, vendor-specific implementation constraints, limited cross-site model transferability, and fragmented governance of safety, bias, and cybersecurity risks. Rigorous, lifecycle-based evaluation frameworks-covering external validation, cost-effectiveness analysis, and post-deployment monitoring-are required to ensure safe, equitable, and sustainable AI adoption.

40732580,Cross-Receiver Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification: A Source-Free Adaptation Approach.,"Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) leverages the unique characteristics of radio signals resulting from inherent hardware imperfections for identification, making it essential for applications in telecommunications, cybersecurity, and surveillance. Despite the advancements brought by deep learning in enhancing RFFI accuracy, challenges persist in model deployment, particularly when transferring RFFI models across different receivers. Variations in receiver hardware can lead to significant performance declines due to shifts in data distribution. This paper introduces the source-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, which centers on adapting pre-trained RF fingerprinting models to new receivers without needing access to original training data from other devices, addressing concerns of data privacy and transmission limitations. We propose a novel approach called contrastive source-free cross-receiver network (CSCNet), which employs contrastive learning to facilitate model adaptation using only unlabeled data from the deployed receiver. By incorporating a three-pronged loss function strategy-minimizing information entropy loss, implementing pseudo-label self-supervised loss, and leveraging contrastive learning loss-CSCNet effectively captures the relationships between signal samples, enhancing recognition accuracy and robustness, thereby directly mitigating the impact of receiver variations and the absence of source data. Our theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation for the generalization performance of SCRFFI, which is corroborated by extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where under realistic noise and channel conditions, that CSCNet significantly improves recognition accuracy and robustness, achieving an average improvement of at least 13% over existing methods and, notably, a 47% increase in specific challenging cross-receiver adaptation tasks.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025

The ScreenTrustCAD study was conducted at the breast radiology department at the Capio S:t Göran Hospital where AI is now implemented in clinical practice. This study reports on how the hospital prepared by exploring risks from an enterprise risk management perspective, i.e., applying a holistic and proactive perspective, and developed risk mitigation actions. The study was conducted as an integral part of the preparations before implementing AI in a breast imaging department. Collaborative ideation sessions were conducted with personnel at the hospital, either directly or indirectly involved with AI, to identify risks. Two external experts with competencies in cybersecurity, machine learning, and the ethical aspects of AI, were interviewed as a complement. The risks identified were analyzed according to an Enterprise Risk Management framework, adopted for healthcare, that assumes risks to be emerging from eight different domains. Finally, appropriate risk mitigation actions were identified and discussed. Twenty-three risks were identified covering seven of eight risk domains, in turn generating 51 suggested risk mitigation actions. Not only does the study indicate the emergence of patient safety risks, but it also shows that there are operational, strategic, financial, human capital, legal, and technological risks. The risks with most suggested mitigation actions were ‘Radiographers unable to answer difficult questions from patients’, ‘Increased risk that patient-reported symptoms are missed by the single radiologist’, ‘Increased pressure on the single reader knowing they are the only radiologist to catch a mistake by AI’, and ‘The performance of the AI algorithm might deteriorate’. Before a clinical integration of AI, hospitals should expand, identify, and address risks beyond immediate patient safety by applying comprehensive and proactive risk management.

40707655,Transfer learning with XAI for robust malware and IoT network security.,"Malware that exploits user privacy has increased in recent decades, and this trend has been linked to shifting international regulations, the expansion of Internet services, and the growth of electronic commerce. Furthermore, it is very challenging to detect privacy malware that uses obfuscation as an evasion tactic due to its behaviour, resilience, and adaptability during runtime. Forensic techniques, such as memory dumping analysis, must be used to enable a system to identify and classify patterns and behaviours that facilitate its eventual identification. This research developed a deep learning model for malware classification on an obfuscated malware dataset, called the MalwareMemoryDump dataset. It implemented transfer learning (TL) to adapt the trained model to NF-TON-IoT and UNSW-NB15, improving intrusion detection in IoT and network traffic. We conducted extensive experiments showing improved accuracy and efficiency in cross-domain detection scenarios. Further, we demonstrate that transfer learning minimises training time and computational requirements compared to training separate models from scratch. Additionally, it offers XAI-based explainability to enhance model transparency and interoperability. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model in handling diverse heterogeneous cybersecurity threats across memory-based malware analysis, IoT security, and traditional network intrusion detection. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated using several key metrics to demonstrate its advantages over conventional methods. Experimental findings show that the proposed framework attains 99.9% accuracy on the MalwareMemoryDump dataset, 96% on the NF-Ton-IoT dataset and UNSW-NB15 datasets. Because of its innovative methodology and ability to generalise datasets, the model is a highly effective approach that outperforms many of the most recent malware detection and other security techniques.",Scientific reports,2025

40702020,A hybrid approach combining Bayesian networks and logistic regression for enhancing risk assessment.,"This study enhances cybersecurity risk assessment by integrating Bayesian Networks (BN) and Logistic Regression (LR) models, using data from the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog. First, a probabilistic causal model is built as a BN to capture complex interdependencies among vulnerability characteristics such as CVSS score, exploit complexity, and attack vector. Conditional probabilities of exploitation are calculated, providing a nuanced, evidence-based understanding of each factor's contribution to risk. Second, these posterior probabilities serve as input features for an LR classifier, combining the BN's dependency structure with LR's discriminative power to predict vulnerability risk levels. Parameter estimation employs maximum likelihood methods, supplemented by expert knowledge where data are sparse. When applied to 775 vulnerability records, the BN-LR hybrid achieves an accuracy rate of 97% and a ROC-AUC of 0.1 on the held-out test set, outperforming both standalone BN (accuracy 86.7%, AUC 0.89) and standalone LR (accuracy 88.1%, AUC 0.90). Sensitivity analysis further highlights that CVSS score and exploit complexity carry the greatest influence on risk predictions. By quantifying both causal relationships and classification boundaries, the integrated model not only improves predictive performance but also offers clear insights into which attributes most strongly drive potential exploits. This practical tool thus enables security teams to prioritize remediation efforts effectively, strengthening organizational vulnerability management and overall security posture.",Scientific reports,2025
40701989,A novel ensemble Wasserstein GAN framework for effective anomaly detection in industrial internet of things environments.,"Imbalanced datasets in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments pose a serious challenge for reliable pattern classification. Critical instances of minority classes (such as anomalies or system faults) are often vastly outnumbered by routine data, making them difficult to detect. Traditional resampling and machine learning methods struggle with such skewed data, usually failing to identify these rare but significant events. To address this, we introduce a two-stage generative oversampling framework called Enhanced Optimization of Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (EO-WGAN). This enhanced WGAN-based Oversampling approach combines the strengths of the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN). First, SMOTE interpolates new minority-class examples to roughly balance the dataset. Next, a WGAN is trained on this augmented data to refine and generate high-fidelity minority samples that preserve the complex non-linear feature distributions characteristic of IIoT data. Unlike prior SMOTE and GAN methods, our framework leverages the Wasserstein loss for more stable training. It incorporates an optimized sampling strategy to ensure that the synthetic data meaningfully extends the classifier's decision boundaries. Integrating an advanced oversampling technique with a critic-guided generative model significantly improves minority-class recognition, eliminating the need for extensive feature engineering or domain-specific tuning. We validate EO-WGAN on an IIoT cybersecurity dataset (UNSW-NB15) and several other imbalanced benchmarks. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art oversampling techniques, achieving up to 95.2% accuracy (with precision and recall of 94.6% and 95.4%, respectively) in our experiments. EO-WGAN offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and its generality makes it applicable to other domains that face severe class imbalance. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the detection of minority-class events, resulting in more reliable industrial analytics and informed operational decision-making.",Scientific reports,2025
40697030,Study of insulin infusion in diabetic rats with an ultra-low-cost insulin pump for managing blood glucose levels.,"This study assesses the accuracy of an ultra-low-cost insulin pump for regulating blood glucose, an essential component of the artificial pancreas. The primary objective is to assess the accuracy of blood glucose regulation using an ultra-low-cost insulin pump compared with insulin injections. The study was conducted using 14 male Wistar rats aged 14 weeks, which were induced with diabetes through a streptozotocin procedure. The control group (seven subjects) was treated with subcutaneous insulin injections, and the study group (seven subjects) was treated with the experimental insulin pump. Our findings reveal that the ultra-low-cost insulin pump performs comparably to insulin injections for glycemia regulation using standard clinical insulin treatment. The blood glucose records obtained by CGM indicate that trends in both methods correspond, with a glycemia median absolute relative difference of 6.1748 mg/dL and an interquartile range of 14.57 mg/dL. The response time to reach glucose levels between 70 and 180 mg/dL was around 55 min, testing different amounts of insulin units ranging from 0.09 to 2.06 U. Also, four obstruction cases were detected by the system in an average time of 3 s, showing compliance with the EN60601-2-24 standard. The in vivo experiments with diabetic rats and ultra-low-cost insulin pumps demonstrate that these prototypes can be used for glucose regulation in clinical trials while complying with the conditions of the EN60601-2-24 standard. Future work should focus on conducting insulin pump tests in a closed loop and a cybersecurity study to prevent any possible external attack.",Journal of diabetes investigation,2025

Advances in the Vehicular Internet of Things (VIoT) technology enable communication among vehicles as well as roadside facilities, offering effective traffic flow and security control. However, the vehicular networks are exposed to increased risks from cyberattacks, particularly from incoming quantum computers with the ability to interpret out-of-date conventional codes. This paper proposes a security solution based on post-quantum cryptography (PQC), which enhances Ascon encryption by adding quantum-proof key exchange. This method ensures secure authentication and protects against replay, sybil, collision, phishing, and man-in-the-middle attacks. A 32-bit Ascon hash coupled with SHA-512 provides data integrity. Investigations on resource-constrained vehicular environments confirm that the new scheme provides better performance, producing 128-512-bit keys in microseconds, much quicker than Kyber and Falcon. It also outperforms Ascon in hash rendering speed, completing a 256 × 256 grayscale image in 0.0782s, compared to 0.822s for standard Ascon, thereby emphasizing its ability to provide secure, immediate communication between vehicles in scenarios sensitive to quantum technologies. These observations show that the suggested approach is strongly secure and computationally efficient, and hence it is suitable for protecting future connected and autonomous vehicles from cyberattacks in the quantum era.",Scientific reports,2025

Widespread technology outages affecting health care delivery organizations may impact clinical care. To determine the availability of health care delivery organization internet-connected networks before, during, and after the faulty CrowdStrike software update of July 19, 2024. This cross-sectional study measured availability of health care delivery organization networks by performing scans on internet address ranges and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) end points corresponding to individual hospitals, spanning various sizes, geographic range, and organizational types, assessing responsivity to scans 2 weeks before, during, and 2 weeks after the CrowdStrike update. Hospitals affiliated with US-based health care delivery organizations that used the Epic electronic health record and that had publicly observable internet services, including FHIR end points, were included. Data were analyzed from July 19, 2024, to May 17, 2025. A widely distributed faulty software update for enterprise cybersecurity software distributed on July 19, 2024, which, when installed on computers, resulted in a system crash. The primary outcome was loss of response to internet scanning techniques indicating computer system downtime. A secondary analysis was performed on unresponsive domains attempting to identify the function of the network services provided. Among 2232 hospitals with available data, loss of response to internet scanning techniques immediately following the CrowdStrike update was observed in 759 hospitals (34.0%).

40674342,Enhanced SVM-based model for predicting cyberspace vulnerabilities: Analyzing the role of user group dynamics and capital influx.,"Amid substantial capital influx and the rapid evolution of online user groups, the increasing complexity of user behavior poses significant challenges to cybersecurity, particularly in the domain of vulnerability prediction. This study aims to enhance the accuracy and practical applicability of cyberspace vulnerability prediction. By incorporating the dynamics of user behavioral changes and the logic of platform scaling driven by investment, two representative cybersecurity datasets are selected for analysis: the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection System 2017 and the Network-Based Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset 2015. A standardized data preprocessing pipeline is constructed, including redundancy elimination, feature selection, and sample balancing, to ensure data representativeness and compatibility. To address the limited adaptability of traditional support vector machine (SVM) models in identifying nonlinear attacks, this study introduces a distribution-driven, dynamically adaptive kernel optimization approach. This method adjusts kernel parameters or switches kernel functions in real time according to the statistical characteristics of input data, thereby improving the model's generalization capability and responsiveness in complex attack scenarios. Performance evaluations are conducted on both datasets using cross-validation.

40659282,The Psychological Impact of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators: A Narrative Review.,"Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are critical to the prevention of sudden cardiac death caused by life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. While their clinical value is well-established, the psychological impact of living with an ICD remains underrecognized. Patients often experience anticipatory anxiety, depression, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and reduced quality of life. These challenges can begin before implantation, persist after both appropriate and inappropriate shocks, and be worsened by fears of device malfunction, recalls, or cybersecurity risks. Many patients alter postimplantation behaviors, avoiding physical activity and reporting diminished trust in medical technology. The burden is especially significant in children, alongside those who experience multiple or unnecessary shocks. Despite increased awareness, mental health care remains poorly integrated into cardiology. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), structured patient education, and transparent communication around device updates and recalls have shown effectiveness.

40656511,Intelligent dynamic cybersecurity risk management framework with explainability and interpretability of AI models for enhancing security and resilience of digital infrastructure.,"The sophistication of cyberattacks has significantly increased, making it almost certain that organizations can be victims of cyberattacks at any time. Managing cybersecurity risk is critical for any organization so that informed decisions can be made to tackle risks before they materialize. Cybersecurity risk management is context-specific and heavily relies on the specific organization's context. However, performing effective risk management is always challenging due to the constant changes in organizational infrastructure and security posture, including the adoption of new applications and the reconfiguration or updating of existing assets and their dependencies, as well as the potential exploitation of vulnerabilities. Despite the wider adoption of AI enabled cybersecurity risk management, there is a lack of focus on the integration of these systems along with the dynamic elements of the risk management. In this context, this research proposes a novel dynamic cyber security risk management (d-CSRM) framework to tackle this challenge by integrating dynamic parameters such as vulnerability exploitation and assets dependencies for assessing and managing the risk. The framework consists of a systemic process and makes use of a hybrid AI-enabled model that combines both linear regression and deep learning, to prioritize the vulnerabilities. Additionally, d-CSRM integrates the explainability and interpretability characteristics of the AI model for explaining model decision making and the inner working parameters. This allows the extraction of the key features that are linked with the risk and informed decision making to tackle the risks. An experiment was performed to prioritize the vulnerabilities from the widely used CVEjoin dataset using the proposed hybrid model to quantify the dynamic risk with explainability. The results show that the hybrid model effectively identifies and prioritizes the most critical vulnerabilities using the selected key features such as exploit type, exploit platform and impact that can further enhance the dynamic risk assessment.",Journal of reliable intelligent environments,2025

To address this gap, we propose ESA-BotRGCN, an emoji-driven multi-modal detection framework that integrates semantic enhancement, sentiment analysis, and multi-dimensional feature modeling. Specifically, we first establish emoji-text mapping relationships using the Emoji Library, leverage GPT-4 to improve textual coherence, and generate tweet embeddings via RoBERTa. Subsequently, seven sentiment-based features are extracted to quantify statistical disparities in emotional expression patterns between bot and human accounts. An attention gating mechanism is further designed to dynamically fuse these sentiment features with user description, tweet content, numerical attributes, and categorical features. Finally, a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) is employed to model heterogeneous social topology for robust bot detection.

Machine learning-based detection approaches have improved the accuracy of malware identification, thereby providing more effective protection for Android users. However, graph-based detection methods rely on whole-graph computations instead of subgraph-level analyses, and they often ignore the semantic information of individual nodes. Moreover, limited attention has been paid to the interpretability of these models, hindering a deeper understanding of malicious behaviors and restricting their utility in supporting cybersecurity professionals for further in-depth research. To address these challenges, we propose GSIDroid, a novel subgraph-driven and interpretable Android malware detection framework designed to enhance detection performance, reduce computational overhead, protect user security, and assist security experts in rigorous malware analysis. GSIDroid focuses on extracting suspicious subgraphs, integrating deep and shallow-semantic features with permission information, and incorporating both global and local interpretability modules to ensure transparent, trustworthy, and analyzable detection results.

40646087,Multistage adaptive cyberattack in power systems with CNN identification feedback loops.,"The increasing integration of digital technologies in hybrid hydrogen-power networks has introduced new cybersecurity vulnerabilities that existing static or single-phase cyberattack models fail to adequately exploit or defend against. These models typically lack dynamic adaptability, coordination across multiple attack stages, and obfuscation mechanisms, thereby limiting their effectiveness and realism. To address this gap, we propose a novel Cyberattack Design Based on CNN-DQN-Blockchain Technology for Targeted Adaptive Strategy (CDB-TAS)-a three-stage, dynamically evolving cyberattack framework tailored for hybrid hydrogen-electric networks. The proposed CDB-TAS model comprises: (i) a Preliminary Reconnaissance Phase, where a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) identifies the most vulnerable buses via real-time anomaly detection; (ii) an Escalation Phase, where a Double Deep Q-Network (Double DQN) dynamically refines the attack strategy based on grid response and demand profiles; and (iii) a Sustained Attack Phase, which maintains high-intensity disruptions while minimizing detection through continuous feedback adaptation. Additionally, a private blockchain network is employed not for defense, but as an attacker-side obfuscation layer-concealing attack metadata and enabling decentralized coordination among malicious nodes. Simulations on a synthetic 2000-bus hybrid hydrogen-power system modeled after ERCOT reveal that CDB-TAS induces up to 15% voltage drop at critical buses (e.g., Bus 3103), disrupts over 600 MW of load across 50 substations, and achieves 23.4% higher disruption efficiency with lower anomaly detection rates compared to baseline attacks.

40640290,Lightweight machine learning framework for efficient DDoS attack detection in IoT networks.,"The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced significant security challenges, with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks posing a critical threat to network integrity. Traditional detection methods often rely on computationally intensive models, rendering them unsuitable for resource-constrained IoT environments. To address this limitation, this study proposes a lightweight and scalable machine learning-based DDoS detection framework specifically designed for IoT networks. Utilizing the NSL-KDD dataset, the framework employs an Extra Trees Classifier (ETC) for feature selection, reducing dimensionality while retaining critical attributes. Reduced features were selected to enhance performance and reduce processing cost. Three supervised learning models, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes, were implemented and evaluated based on their detection accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental results demonstrate that the Random Forest model achieves exceptional accuracy (99.88%), precision (99.93%), recall (99.81%), and F1-score (99.87%), outperforming both Logistic Regression (91.61% accuracy) and Naïve Bayes (87.62% accuracy). Furthermore, the proposed framework significantly reduces computational overhead compared to deep learning-based approaches, making it highly suitable for IoT deployments. This research advances IoT security by providing a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution for detecting DDoS attacks, thereby bridging the gap between high-performance requirements and resource limitations in real-world IoT applications.",Scientific reports,2025
40634417,Leveraging explainable artificial intelligence for early detection and mitigation of cyber threat in large-scale network environments.,"Cybersecurity has often gained much popularity over the years in a fast-evolving discipline, as the number of cybercriminals and threats rises consistently to stay ahead of law enforcement. Recently, cybercriminals have become more complex with their approaches, though the underlying motives for conducting cyber threats remain largely the same. Classical cybersecurity solutions have become poor at identifying and alleviating evolving cyber threats. Machine learning (ML) plays a crucial role in cybersecurity by making malware detection more scalable, efficient, and automated, reducing reliance on conventional human intervention methods. The cybersecurity domain comprises ML challenges that require effective theoretical and methodical handling. Various statistical and ML approaches, like Bayesian classification, deep learning (DL), and support vector machines (SVM), have efficiently alleviated cyber threats. The insights and hidden trends detected from network data and the architecture of a data-driven ML to avoid this attack are essential to establishing an intelligent security system. This study develops a novel Leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Early Detection and Mitigation of Cyber Threats in Large-Scale Network Environments (LXAIDM-CTLSN) method. The projected LXAIDM-CTLSN method aims to recognize and classify cyber-attacks in achieving cybersecurity. Initially, the normalization is performed using Min-max normalization to standardize the data. The Mayfly Optimization Algorithm (MOA) is then utilized for feature selection, effectively mitigating computational complexity. A Sparse Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) model recognizes and classifies cyber threats. Additionally, the Hiking Optimization Algorithm (HOA) is employed to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the SDAE model. Finally, the XAI method LIME is integrated to enhance the explainability and understanding of the Blackbox technique, ensuring superior classification of cyberattacks. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the overall robustness of the proposed XAIDM-CTLSN method using the NSLKDD2015 and CICIDS2017 datasets. The experimental validation of the XAIDM-CTLSN method portrayed a superior accuracy value of 99.09% over other techniques.",Scientific reports,2025

41037359,Why tomorrow's public health needs to be digital: artificial intelligence and automation for a sustainable Italian National Health Service.,"Italy's National Health Service (SSN) serves one of Europe's oldest populations under fiscal constraint and a fragmented data infrastructure. Rather than a standalone fix, artificial intelligence should be treated as a catalyst for a human-centred digital transformation that improves access, quality, and sustainability. Building on the Italian Society for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (SIIAM) vision, we outline a pragmatic agenda. First, reduce elective-care backlogs by automating confirmations, reminders, cancellations, and rescheduling; deploy multilingual conversational agents to collect structured pre-visit histories and deliver summaries, while natural-language processing flags overdue follow-ups. Second, advance equity by offering inclusive digital front doors and tele-triage that prioritise patients facing language, literacy, socioeconomic, or geographic barriers. Third, curb waste through clinical-decision support and workflow automation that standardise evidence-based practice and relieve documentation burden. Fourth, modernise surveillance by pairing large language model powered voice agents for behaviour and symptom monitoring with participatory systems and AI epidemic intelligence. Fifth, link data and people through multidisciplinary teams and a human-in-the-loop approach that embeds transparency, bias mitigation, privacy, and safety. Implementation should start where impact is fastest: risk-stratified booking, proactive reminders, and shared dashboards with comparable indicators. To sustain gains, ring-fence resources for regional multidisciplinary units, enforce interoperability and reference datasets, and align procurement with European requirements for auditability and post-deployment monitoring. AI can help reshape Italian healthcare, but success ultimately depends on integrated data, trained teams, and robust governance.",Recenti progressi in medicina,2025
41037357,[Artificial intelligence for italian medicine: navigating between innovation and practice.].,"""Artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare"": this sentence is now so common it risks losing meaning. Technology alone does not change systems, people do: clinicians, researchers, decision-makers, and patients. AI is a lever, but without a fulcrum of skills, vision, and responsibility, it moves nothing. This conviction is at the core of the Italian Society for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (SIIAM) and of the 3rd Annual Meeting (Naples, October 10-11, 2025). Our aim is not to celebrate technology for its own sake, but to bring together a multidisciplinary community capable of deciding how to use AI responsibly in the Italian healthcare system. This issue of Recenti Progressi in Medicina presents the collective output of this effort: commentaries by the Scientific Committee and contributions from participants. It is shown how rules and principles can be translated into practice, how Italian healthcare can evolve toward a Learning Health System, and why responsible infrastructures and evaluation frameworks are needed to guide AI innovation. Case studies highlight both promising advances and pitfalls to avoid. The central question is not whether AI will change medicine, but how we can use it to have a more equitable, proactive, sustainable and personalized one?

It is on this fulcrum that SIIAM continues to work, with rigor, openness, and trust, so that innovation becomes daily practice for the benefit of patients and professionals alike.",Recenti progressi in medicina,2025
40970008,Comparing Artificial Intelligence Large Language Models in Medical Training: A Performance Analysis of ChatGPT and DeepSeek on United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Style Questions.,"Introduction The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical education is reshaping how students prepare for standardized examinations. Prior studies have shown that AI models can achieve high accuracy on United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) questions, highlighting their potential for examination preparation. ChatGPT (GPT), especially the 4o model, is one of the most widely used AI models; however, its accessibility is limited by subscription costs and regional censorship. DeepSeek (DS), a newer AI model, offers free access and has demonstrated comparable performance in general tasks. In this study, we compared the performance of GPT-4o and DS DeepThink R1 on the AMBOSS medical board preparation question bank to evaluate their potential and limitations as supplementary tools in medical education. Methods We extracted 1,079 USMLE-style multiple-choice questions from the AMBOSS question bank. Questions were categorized by USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 examinations and further grouped by topic, resulting in 36 categories. Each question was assigned a difficulty level (easy, intermediate, or hard) based on AMBOSS grading criteria. To ensure balanced representation, we randomly selected 10 questions per difficulty level per category. Questions and answer choices were copied verbatim from the AMBOSS website and input into GPT-4o and DS R1 without any modification. Model responses were scored as correct or incorrect, and correctness rates were compared across GPT-4o, DS R1, and AMBOSS user performance. Results Both GPT and DS outperformed AMBOSS users, with overall accuracies of 88.79%, 78.68%, and 56.98%, respectively. Comparing GPT and DS, GPT performed significantly better overall (t=7.90, p<0.0001). When stratified by examination type, GPT achieved significantly higher accuracy than DS in both Step 1 (0.89 vs. 0.78, p < 0.0001) and Step 2 (0.88 vs. 0.80, p < 0.0001). GPT consistently showed higher accuracy than DS at all three difficulty levels. However, when further stratified by examination type, statistically significances were only observed in intermediate (p = 0.0002) and hard (p = 0.0021) questions in both Step 1 and Step 2. Conclusion Our findings demonstrated that both AI models outperformed human learners, with GPT-4o showing superior accuracy, particularly in intermediate and hard questions. While DS underperformed relative to GPT, its free accessibility and competitive accuracy in easy questions suggest that it may serve as a viable alternative, particularly in resource-limited settings.",Cureus,2025

The modern foundations of AI, with theoretical roots dating back to ancient Egyptian and Greek civilisations, were laid by Alan Turing and John McCarthy in the twentieth century. Early practices in the medical field focused on the archiving and interpretation of radiologic images and possible preliminary diagnoses. As the processing capacity of computers has advanced, so has their skill competence, and it has become possible to implement them in different specialty branches of medicine. On the other hand, ethical, and social problems, dilemmas, and conflicts have begun to arise with practices in the healthcare field. In this sense, AI should be addressed with its potential benefits and problems, knowing that it is tool, free from social prejudices, demographic changes, socio-economic inequalities, and cultural differences and without indulging in dichotomies such as technophilia and technophobia.",Thoracic research and practice,2025
40951039,"Role of Artificial Intelligence in Gastroenterology Training (2005-2025): Trends, Tools, and Challenges.","Over the past two decades, gastroenterology training (GI training) has undergone a significant transformation through the integration of advanced technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI). The emergence of AI as a transformative tool has facilitated notable changes in how GI trainees acquire knowledge and skills. Key applications of AI in this context include simulation-based learning, diagnostic decision support, and procedural skill acquisition. These AI-driven innovations are increasingly recognised for enhancing learning efficiency, improving diagnostic accuracy, and building procedural confidence among trainees. To explore the extent of AI's impact on GI education, a comprehensive literature review was conducted. The search followed PRISMA guidelines and focused on peer-reviewed articles published between 2005 and 2025. Databases such as PubMed/NCBI, ScienceDirect, and the Cochrane Library were used, along with targeted searches in leading GI journals. The initial search yielded 312 records. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 22 studies were selected for final synthesis. These included randomised controlled trials, observational studies, systematic reviews, and narrative analyses. The reviewed studies consistently demonstrated that AI-enhanced simulation tools, particularly those incorporating virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), played a pivotal role in procedural training. These tools offered immersive, risk-free environments that allowed trainees to practice and refine their technical skills before applying them in real-world clinical scenarios. AI also proved valuable in diagnostic decision support. Systems such as computer-aided detection (CADe) were shown to significantly increase lesion detection rates during endoscopic procedures, contributing to improved clinical decision-making and better patient outcomes. Additionally, AI-assisted technologies enhanced procedural training by supporting more precise biopsy targeting and facilitating lesion identification during endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). As per our review, the evidence suggests that AI technologies are making meaningful contributions to GI training by improving diagnostic capabilities, streamlining the learning process, and supporting technical skill acquisition. However, despite these promising developments, further research is necessary. Future studies should include multi-centre randomised controlled trials and longitudinal evaluations to establish long-term efficacy. Furthermore, efforts toward global standardisation of AI training tools and equitable access are essential to ensure that these technologies benefit trainees across diverse clinical settings.",Cureus,2025

40895978,Performance of the ChatGPT-4o Language Model in Solving the Ophthalmology Specialization Exam.,"Background Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly language models such as ChatGPT, is gaining importance in medical education and knowledge assessment. Previous studies have demonstrated the growing effectiveness of AI in solving medical exams, including the Final Medical Examination (LEK) and Polish State Specialization Exam (PES) in various specialties, raising questions about its usefulness as a tool to support specialist training processes. Objective The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the latest ChatGPT-4o model in solving the PES in ophthalmology. The analysis focused on the accuracy of the answers and the model's declared confidence level to evaluate its potential educational usefulness. Methods The study was based on the official PES ophthalmology exam (Spring 2024), consisting of 120 multiple-choice questions. The ChatGPT-4o model was familiarized with the exam regulations and questions, which were input in Polish. The effectiveness of the answers was assessed based on the Medical Education Center (CEM) answer key, as well as the model's declared confidence level (on a scale of 1 to 5). The questions were divided into clinical and theoretical categories. Data were analyzed statistically using the chi-square test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Results The model provided 94 correct answers (78.3%), exceeding the passing threshold. No significant difference in effectiveness was observed between clinical and non-clinical questions (p = 0.709). The analysis of the confidence level revealed that correct answers were significantly more often provided with higher confidence (p < 0.001), suggesting that the model's self-assessment could be an indicator of answer accuracy. Conclusions ChatGPT-4o demonstrated high effectiveness in the PES ophthalmology exam, confirming the potential of AI in specialist education.

40895899,Can Residency Programs Detect Artificial Intelligence Use in Personal Statements?,"To evaluate widely used artificial intelligence (AI) detectors' ability to identify ChatGPT's (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA, USA) use in personal statements submitted as part of the residency program application. This qualitative analysis was performed to evaluate the ability of three different AI detectors to detect the use of AI in personal statements submitted as part of residency applications for obstetrics and gynecology. A total of 25 writings were selected and analyzed by GPTZero (Princeton, NJ, USA), Undetectable AI (Sheridan, WY, USA), and Winston AI (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). In total, 25 separate writing samples of approximately 700 words were entered into three different AI detectors. AI-generated works had high rates of AI-detection, while classic literature samples had low rates of detection. Human-written personal statements before and after the availability of ChatGPT technology results were mixed, with results ranging from 64-100% and 3-100% of content appearing to be AI, respectively. AI-chatbots have been shown to produce writing that may be indistinguishable from human work and may already be commonly used to create personal statements. It is unclear who is utilizing ChatGPT in their writing, and residency programs everywhere will seek a reliable way to detect unethical usage. This study shows that available AI detectors may be able to detect AI use in applicants' personal statements, but the use of invalidated tools may harm honest applicants.

40881554,The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Guidelines vs. Electronic Health Record (EHR)-Based Screening: A Comparative Accuracy Study in Prostate Cancer.,"The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) provides age-based recommendations for prostate cancer screening. Such a single-criterion strategy can not only miss aggressive cancers that occur before the designated cut-off age, but also over-screen men whose cancers occur at a much older age. A multi-factorial model incorporating a wide spectrum of medical history may offer more accurate predictions. Such cancer prediction models may excel by incorporating diverse medical histories, including causal and non-causal conditions, as well as their chronological relationship with the onset of cancer.  This study aims to develop an AI (machine learning)-driven predictive model for prostate cancer based on patients' medical history and compare its performance with traditional age-based criteria. A predictive model was developed based on electronic health records (EHRs) from the <i>All of Us</i> database. A binary indicator for a prostate cancer diagnosis was established using SNOMED codes. Subsequently, a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression model was employed to examine the relationship between all prior health conditions and the cancer indicator, thereby identifying the most predictive features. Predictive performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and McFadden's R². The EHR-based model achieved a 10-fold cross-validated McFadden's R² of 0.36, significantly outperforming a model based on USPSTF eligibility criteria, which had an R² of 0.20. Validation using AUROC further demonstrated that the proposed model outperformed current screening criteria in terms of both sensitivity and specificity. This study highlights the potential of personalized screening strategies and demonstrates that AI-driven prediction models based on EHR data can predict prostate cancer with better accuracy than existing age-based guidelines through non-invasive means. Such approaches may help reduce invasive diagnostic procedures due to unnecessary screening and improve early detection by focusing diagnostic efforts on those most at risk.",Cureus,2025

40857713,Physicians' Attitudes Toward Artificial Intelligence in Medicine: Mixed Methods Survey and Interview Study.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform clinical practice and diagnostics. Amid workforce shortages, AI-based applications assist in decision-making, patient monitoring, and administrative tasks. However, despite enthusiasm, integration into clinical practice remains limited because of concerns about usability, ethical implications, and physicians' acceptance. Understanding physicians' attitudes and engaging them in AI development may foster acceptance and adoption. This study aimed to comprehensively assess physicians' attitudes toward AI in medicine. We conducted a mixed methods study combining a web-based survey and qualitative interviews. The survey explored physicians' perspectives on the advantages and disadvantages of AI, its role in decision-making, and impact on physician-patient communication. Attitudes were measured using a 5-point Likert scale, covering cognitive and affective dimensions. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) identified underlying attitudinal factors, while the Mann-Whitney U and the Kruskal-Wallis tests examined differences in attitudes based on physicians' age, discipline, AI familiarity, and other variables. Overall, 13 physicians, independent of the survey sample, participated in semistructured interviews, which were analyzed using inductive coding and thematic analysis. The survey yielded 498 responses. EFA revealed two factors: (1) AI enthusiasm and acceptance (Cronbach α=0.83) and (2) AI skepticism and apprehension (Cronbach α=0.77). Physicians reported high AI enthusiasm (median 4, IQR 3.57-4.29) and lower skepticism (median 3.62, IQR 3.20-4.20; reverse coded, with higher scores indicating reduced skepticism). Greater AI familiarity, use in daily life or professionally, and involvement in research were strongly associated with greater enthusiasm and lower skepticism. Physicians involved in AI-related research reported significantly higher enthusiasm (mean rank: AI research=111.52; no AI research=54.32; P<.001) and lower skepticism (mean rank: AI research=108.27; no AI research=70.45; P=.01). Those using AI professionally or intending to do so similarly expressed high enthusiasm (mean rank: professional use=253.88; no use=196.17; P=.001) and lower skepticism (mean rank: plan to use=275.93; no use=218.86; P=.001). Greater familiarity with AI tools was also strongly associated with higher enthusiasm (mean rank: very familiar=323.55; not familiar=169.86; P<.001) and lower skepticism (mean rank: very familiar=296.90; not familiar=186.23; P=.008). Chief physicians (mean rank 277.32) were significantly less skeptical than residents (mean rank 210.60; P=.01); however, age and discipline did not influence attitudes. The qualitative analysis identified six themes shaping physicians' attitudes: (1) status quo, (2) AI dependency and negligence, (3) role changes and needs, (4) AI transparency and decision-making, (5) the physician-patient relationship, and (6) a framework for responsible AI integration. These findings led to several key propositions considered critical for AI adoption. AI in medicine is viewed positively, with attitudes shaped more by experience and engagement than by demographic factors. While concerns persist, they diminish with increased familiarity and professional use. These findings highlight the need for targeted education, hands-on training, and standardized implementation strategies to enhance AI engagement and facilitate adoption.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025
40820407,Diagnostic Accuracy of a Large Language Model (ChatGPT-4) for Patients Admitted to a Community Hospital Medical Intensive Care Unit: A Retrospective Case Study.,"BackgroundThe future of artificial intelligence in medicine includes the use of machine learning and large language models to improve diagnostic accuracy, as a point-of-care tool, at the time of admission to an acute care hospital. The large language model, ChatGPT-4, has been shown to diagnose complex medical conditions with accuracies comparable to experienced clinicians, however, most published studies involved curated cases or examination-like questions and are not point-of-care. To test the hypothesis that ChatGPT-4 can make an accurate medical diagnosis using real-world medical cases and a convenient cut and paste strategy, we performed a retrospective case study involving critically ill patients admitted to a community hospital medical intensive care unit.MethodsA redacted H&P was essentially cut and pasted into ChatGPT-4 with uniform instructions to make a leading diagnosis and a list of 5 possibilities as a differential diagnosis. All features that could be used to identify patients were removed to ensure privacy and HIPAA compliance. The ChatGPT-4 diagnoses were compared with critical care physician diagnoses using a blinded longitudinal chart review as the ground truth diagnosis.ResultsA total of 120 randomly selected cases were included in the study. The diagnostic accuracy was 88.3% for physicians and 85.0% for ChatGPT-4, with no significant difference by McNemar testing (p-value of 0.249). The agreement between physician diagnosis and ChatGPT-4 diagnosis was moderate, 0.57 (95% CI: 0.35-0.79), based on Cohen's kappa statistic.ConclusionThese results suggest that ChatGTP-4 achieved diagnostic accuracy comparable to board certified physicians in the context of critically ill patients admitted to a community medical intensive care unit. Furthermore, the agreement was only moderate, suggesting that there may be complementary ways of combining the diagnostic acumen of physicians and ChatGPT-4 to improve overall accuracy. A prospective study would be necessary to determine if ChatGPT-4 could improve patient outcomes as a point-of-care tool at the time of admission.",Journal of intensive care medicine,2025

40734859,"Pharmacovigilance in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: Advancements, Challenges, and Considerations.","Pharmacovigilance (PV) is a science that plays a crucial role in protecting patients by detecting adverse drug reactions (ADRs). PV can do this by collecting and analyzing data from a wide variety of healthcare sources. However, traditional PV methods face limitations, particularly in accurately and efficiently analyzing large datasets. This limitation leads to underreported ADRs, which negatively impact many patients. However, with the recent rise in artificial intelligence, PV as a science has the potential to improve. This can be done by incorporating different subsets of AI, such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), into PV. The aim of this study is to describe how integrating AI, specifically ML and NLP, into PV systems can improve data collection, data processing, and the detection of ADRs. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar to examine studies that were conducted within the last 30 years. Twenty-eight studies were included in this paper. Inclusion criteria included articles that were written in English, articles focusing on PV as a science, ADRs, AI's current role in PV, and AI's potential role in PV. Exclusion criteria included studies that were not published in English and studies that were published more than 30 years ago. The findings from several systematic reviews that explore the implementation of AI into PV indicate that AI can improve PV by enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of detecting ADRs. Through ML algorithms, ADRs can be identified more quickly and accurately compared to traditional PV methods; while using the NLP model, AI is able to extract relevant patient data from unstructured data sources such as electronic health records (EHRs) and report certain drug interactions more accurately and efficiently. However, there are limitations to incorporating AI into PV. These include ethical, legal, and privacy concerns; interpretative limitations if certain datasets are incomplete and are missing information; the lack of current research; and the need to conduct more research on this topic to definitively determine whether AI should be incorporated into PV. With the exponential development of technology such as AI, there is a lot of promise in strengthening PV into a more accurate and efficient ADR detection system. While there is some research highlighting AI's potential to enhance PV, much more research needs to be conducted to fully substantiate this claim. Incorporating AI into PV does, however, have the potential to change ADR detection methods for the better.",Cureus,2025

However, this is a time-intensive process that demands extensive training and expertise. Despite its importance, it is often subjective and not entirely error-free. Over the past decade, pathology has undergone two major transformations. First, the rise in whole slide imaging has enabled work in front of a computer screen and the integration of image processing tools to enhance diagnostics. Second, the rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized numerous fields and has had a remarkable impact on humanity. The synergy of these two has paved the way for groundbreaking research aiming for advancements in digital pathology. Despite encouraging research outcomes, AI-based tools have yet to be actively incorporated into therapeutic protocols. This is primary due to the need for high reliability in medical therapy, necessitating a new approach that ensures greater robustness. Another approach for improving pathological diagnosis involves advanced optical methods such as spectral imaging, which reveals information from the tissue that is beyond human vision. We have recently developed a unique rapid spectral imaging system capable of scanning pathological slides, delivering a wealth of critical diagnostic information. Here, we present a novel application of spectral imaging (SI) for virtual Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining using a custom-built, rapid Fourier-based SI system. Unstained human biopsy samples are scanned, and a Pix2Pix-based neural network generates realistic H&E-equivalent images. Additionally, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the spectral information to examine the effect of down sampling the data on the virtual staining process. To assess model performance, we trained and tested models using full spectral data, RGB, and PCA-reduced spectral inputs. The results demonstrate that PCA-reduced data preserved essential image features while enhancing statistical image quality, as indicated by FID and KID scores, and reducing computational complexity. These findings highlight the potential of integrating SI and AI to enable efficient, accurate, and stain-free digital pathology.","Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",2025

40551914,Large Language Models Demonstrate Distinct Personality Profiles.,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical medicine to provide emotional support, deliver cognitive-behavioral therapy, and assist in triage and diagnosis. However, as LLMs are integrated into mental health applications, assessing their personality expression and potential divergence from expected neutrality is critical for ensuring clinical safety and therapeutic appropriateness. This study provides the first psychometric analysis of LLM personality, specifically within a medical context, characterizing personality profiles using two validated frameworks: the Open Extended Jungian Type Scales (OEJTS) and the Big Five Personality Test. Four leading LLMs publicly available in April 2024 (ChatGPT-3.5 (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA, USA), Gemini Advanced (Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA), Claude 3 Opus (Anthropic, San Francisco, CA, USA), and Grok-Regular Mode (xAI, Palo Alto, CA, USA)) were evaluated across both psychometric instruments. All tests were administered in a new chat session to prevent memory carryover. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed to assess inter-model differences in personality profiles. MANOVA demonstrated statistically significant differences across models in typological and dimensional personality traits (Wilks' Lambda = 0.115, p < 0.001). OEJTS results showed ChatGPT-3.5 most often classified as Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging (ENTJ) and Claude 3 Opus consistently as Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging (INTJ), while Gemini Advanced and Grok-Regular leaned toward Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging (INFJ). On the Big Five Personality Test, Gemini scored markedly lower on agreeableness and conscientiousness, while Claude scored highest on conscientiousness and emotional stability. Grok-Regular exhibited high openness but more variability in stability. Effect sizes ranged from moderate to large across traits.  Conclusion: Distinct personality profiles are consistently expressed across different LLMs, even in unprompted conditions. Given the increasing integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, these findings underscore the need for formal personality evaluation and oversight involving mental health professionals before deployment.",Cureus,2025
40519433,Assessing Large Language Models for Medical Question Answering in Portuguese: Open-Source Versus Closed-Source Approaches.,"Large language models (LLMs) show promise in medical knowledge assessment. This study benchmarked a closed-source (GPT-4o, OpenAI, San Francisco, CA) and an open-source (LLaMA 3.1 405B, Meta AI, Menlo Park, CA) LLM on 148 multiple-choice questions from the 2023 Portuguese National Residency Access Examination across five clinical domains. Using five distinct prompting strategies, models provided single-best-answer predictions. GPT-4o consistently outperformed LLaMA 3.1 by 7-11% accuracy across all prompts. Chain-of-thought prompting yielded the highest numerical accuracy for GPT-4o, though this improvement was not statistically significant over simpler prompts in post-hoc analyses, while offering minimal benefit when applied to LLaMA 3.1. Both models performed best in pediatrics and less accurately in surgery and psychiatry questions. Bias assessment indicated GPT-4o aligned well with correct answer distributions, unlike LLaMA 3.1, which showed prompt-dependent skew. Closed-source models currently demonstrate higher accuracy on Portuguese medical questions, likely due to extensive training. However, open-source models remain valuable for data control, though domain-focused fine-tuning may be needed for optimal performance in high-stakes applications.",Cureus,2025

Large language models, such as ChatGPT, have the potential to enhance perioperative medicine through education and clinical practice. However, concerns remain regarding the accuracy of these models, particularly the risk of hallucinations, generating factually incorrect outputs. This feasibility test explores the use of a large language model-enabled platform to assist in case-based education in perioperative clinical cases. Five perioperative cases addressing core topics were developed and uploaded to a custom large language model platform. The large language model platform allows free-text questions to be asked to the artificial intelligence, which then uses the derived cases to provide answers. Anaesthetic trainees engaged with the artificial intelligence, asking questions to obtain information regarding history, examination, and investigations. Artificial intelligence question-and-answer pairs were then evaluated independently in duplicate for the presence of inappropriate responses, including hallucinations. The large language model responded appropriately to nearly all questions, with no hallucinations observed. The proportion of questions that were answered appropriately was 99.3% (543/547). In the four instances of inappropriate responses, the large language model declined to provide information in the case description rather than hallucinate. The large language model appears capable of supporting the delivery of case-based perioperative medicine content with a high degree of accuracy.",Journal of perioperative practice,2025

40354306,An inherently interpretable AI model improves screening speed and accuracy for early diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a frequent complication of diabetes, affecting millions worldwide. Screening for this disease based on fundus images has been one of the first successful use cases for modern artificial intelligence in medicine. However, current state-of-the-art systems typically use black-box models to make referral decisions, requiring post-hoc methods for AI-human interaction and clinical decision support. We developed and evaluated an inherently interpretable deep learning model, which explicitly models the local evidence of DR as part of its network architecture, for clinical decision support in early DR screening. We trained the network on 34,350 high-quality fundus images from a publicly available dataset and validated its performance on a large range of ten external datasets. The inherently interpretable model was compared to post-hoc explainability techniques applied to a standard DNN architecture. For comparison, we obtained detailed lesion annotations from ophthalmologists on 65 images to study if the class evidence maps highlight clinically relevant information. We tested the clinical usefulness of our model in a retrospective reader study, where we compared screening for DR without AI support to screening with AI support with and without AI explanations. The inherently interpretable deep learning model obtained an accuracy of .906 [.900-.913] (95%-confidence interval) and an AUC of .904 [.894-.913] on the internal test set and similar performance on external datasets, comparable to the standard DNN. High evidence regions directly extracted from the model contained clinically relevant lesions such as microaneurysms or hemorrhages with a high precision of .960 [.941-.976], surpassing post-hoc techniques applied to a standard DNN. Decision support by the model highlighting high-evidence regions in the image improved screening accuracy for difficult decisions and improved screening speed.

40248538,Evaluating the Performance and Safety of Large Language Models in Generating Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Management Plans: A Comparative Study With Physicians Using Real Patient Records.,"Background The integration of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 into healthcare presents potential benefits and challenges. While LLMs show promise in applications ranging from scientific writing to personalized medicine, their practical utility and safety in clinical settings remain under scrutiny. Concerns about accuracy, ethical considerations, and bias necessitate rigorous evaluation of these technologies against established medical standards. Methods This study involved a comparative analysis using anonymized patient records from a healthcare setting in the state of West Bengal, India. Management plans for 50 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were generated by GPT-4 and three physicians, who were blinded to each other's responses. These plans were evaluated against a reference management plan based on American Diabetes Society guidelines. Completeness, necessity, and dosage accuracy were quantified and a Prescribing Error Score was devised to assess the quality of the generated management plans. The safety of the management plans generated by GPT-4 was also assessed. Results Results indicated that physicians' management plans had fewer missing medications compared to those generated by GPT-4 (p=0.008). However, GPT-4-generated management plans included fewer unnecessary medications (p=0.003). No significant difference was observed in the accuracy of drug dosages (p=0.975). The overall error scores were comparable between physicians and GPT-4 (p=0.301). Safety issues were noted in 16% of the plans generated by GPT-4, highlighting potential risks associated with AI-generated management plans. Conclusion The study demonstrates that while GPT-4 can effectively reduce unnecessary drug prescriptions, it does not yet match the performance of physicians in terms of plan completeness. The findings support the use of LLMs as supplementary tools in healthcare, highlighting the need for enhanced algorithms and continuous human oversight to ensure the efficacy and safety of artificial intelligence in clinical settings.",Cureus,2025
40242709,A Machine Learning Model for Predicting Depression in Moroccan Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients.,"Background and objective Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory condition that significantly impacts the quality of life. Depression in RA exacerbates pain and reduces the likelihood of remission. Predicting depression in RA is often neglected due to time and resource constraints. Hence, this study aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model for predicting depression in RA patients. Methodology We included 112 RA patients from CHU Hassan II, Fez, Morocco. Depression was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scale, and clinical data were extracted from medical records. Twelve features were used to develop five ML models: support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and gradient boosting classifier (GBC). Data preprocessing involved managing missing values, normalizing data, and encoding variables. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). Results The ML-based feature selection method showed the optimal performance. The LR model performed best in predicting depression, with 76.5% accuracy, 72.2% precision, 81.2% recall, an F1 score of 0.765, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of 0.767. Conclusions Our study highlights the significance of ML models in predicting depression in RA patients. The selected features and the LR model showed promising performance. Further research is required to validate these results and develop more advanced models.

40234491,Accurate bladder cancer diagnosis using ensemble deep leaning.,"There are an estimated 1.3 million cases of cancer globally each year, making it one of the most serious types of urinary tract cancer. The methods used today for diagnosing and monitoring bladder cancer are intrusive, costly, and time-consuming. In clinical practice, invasive biopsy followed by histological examination continues to be the gold standard for diagnosis. Bladder cancer biomarkers have been used in expensive diagnostic tests created recently, however their reliability is limited by their high rates of false positives and false negatives. The potential and use of artificial intelligence in urological diseases have been the subject of several research, as interest in artificial intelligence in medicine has grown recently. In this paper, a new bladder cancer model called Ensemble Deep Learning (EDL) will be provided to accurately diagnose patients. Outlier rejection is used to filter data using the interquartile range (IQR) then the image diagnosis. The proposed EDL consists of three deep learning algorithms, which are; Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and a new deep learning method called Explainable Deep Learning (XDL) that depends on Guided Gradient Weighted Class Activation Map (Guided Grad-CAM). In fact, Guided Grad-CAM enables doctor to understand the diagnose. A new voting mechanism will be used to integrate the results of all three methods to produce the final result to accurately diagnose bladder cancer cases. In fact, the used voting method depends on using majority voting based on two different scenarios according to the results of CNN, GAN, and XDL. If these three methods give the same class category, then the final diagnosis will be this class category. On the other hand, if the three methods give different class category, then the final result will be followed by the accuracy of each class. The proposed EDL model was tested after several trials. The results have proved that EDL model is more efficient and more accurate to diagnose bladder cancer disease. It introduced the highest accuracy results and the lowest error results as well as execution time.",Scientific reports,2025
40220757,Clinician-artificial intelligence collaboration: A win-win solution for efficiency and reliability in atrial fibrillation diagnosis.,"Given the biases and ethical concerns of AI models, the fully automatic diagnosis of diseases in clinical settings is challenging. In contrast, clinician-AI collaboration is considered essential to ensure the validity and reliability of utilizing AI models in clinical practice. However, effective strategies for clinician-AI collaboration remain largely unexplored. This study proposed a three-step general clinician-AI collaboration pipeline aimed at improving disease diagnosis efficiency: first, utilizing large real-world clinical datasets to evaluate and clarify clinicians' diagnostic strengths/weaknesses; second, developing an AI model to complement clinicians' weakness in disease diagnosis; and finally, proposing a clinician-AI collaboration strategy to leverage the strengths of both AI and clinicians. The effectiveness of this pipeline was validated through a study focusing on clinical paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) detection, utilizing 24-h Holter recordings from over 30,000 patients. In PAF detection, clinicians alone required a significant amount of time to identify the data and still overlooked 13.7% of PAF patients but successfully identified all non-atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Conversely, AI alone rarely missed PAF patients but misidentified 23.3% of non-AF patients as having PAF. After implementing the proposed clinician-AI collaboration strategy, all patients were correctly identified, and clinicians' workload was reduced by 76.7%. This study improves both the efficiency and reliability of PAF detection, bridging the gap between AI model development and its clinical application, thereby effectively promoting the application of AI models in clinical AF screening. This study was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.","Med (New York, N.Y.)",2025

LLMs have recently gained importance, but their practical application in hospitals and practices has so far been limited. Research and implementation are hampered by a complex legal situation. It is essential to research LLMs in clinical studies in Germany and to develop guidelines for users. How can foundations for the data protection-compliant use of LLMs, particularly cloud-based LLMs, be established in the German healthcare system? The aim of this work is to present the data protection aspects of using cloud-based LLMs in clinical research and patient care in Germany and the European Union (EU); to this end, key statements of a legal opinion on this matter are considered. Insofar as the requirements for use are regulated by state laws (vs. federal laws), the legal situation in Berlin is used as a basis. As part of a research project, a legal opinion was commissioned to clarify the data protection aspects of the use of LLMs with cloud-based solutions at the Charité - University Hospital Berlin, Germany. Specific questions regarding the processing of personal data were examined. The legal framework varies depending on the type of data processing and the relevant federal state (Bundesland). For anonymous data, data protection requirements need not apply. Where personal data is processed, it should be pseudonymized if possible. In the research context, patient consent is usually required to process their personal data, and data processing agreements must be concluded with the providers. Recommendations originating from LLMs must always be reviewed by medical doctors. The use of cloud-based LLMs is possible as long as data protection requirements are observed. The legal framework is complex and requires transparency from providers. Future developments could increase the potential of AI and particularly LLMs in everyday clinical practice; however, clear legal and ethical guidelines are necessary.","Innere Medizin (Heidelberg, Germany)",2025

40034878,Cardiotocography-Based Experimental Comparison of Artificial Intelligence and Human Judgment in Assessing Fetal Asphyxia During Delivery.,"Cardiotocography (CTG) has long been the standard method for monitoring fetal status during delivery. Despite its widespread use, human error and variability in CTG interpretation contribute to adverse neonatal outcomes, with over 70% of stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and brain injuries potentially avoidable through accurate analysis. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer opportunities to address these challenges by complementing human judgment. This study experimentally compared the diagnostic accuracy of AI and human specialists in predicting fetal asphyxia using CTG data. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms were developed and trained on 3,519 CTG datasets. Human specialists independently assessed 50 CTG figures each through web-based questionnaires. A total of 984 CTG figures from singleton pregnancies were evaluated, and outcomes were compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Human diagnosis achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.693 (p = 0.0003), outperforming AI-based methods (ML: AUC = 0.514, p = 0.788; DL: AUC = 0.524, p = 0.662). Although DL-assisted judgment improved sensitivity and identified cases missed by humans, it did not surpass the accuracy of human judgment alone. Combining human and AI predictions yielded a lower AUC (0.693) than human diagnosis alone, but improved specificity (91.92% for humans, 98.03% for humans and DL), highlighting AI's potential to complement human judgment by reducing false-positive rates. Our findings underscore the need for further refinement of AI algorithms and the accumulation of CTG data to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

40009971,Automatic skull reconstruction by deep learnable symmetry enforcement.,"Every year, thousands of people suffer from skull damage and require personalized implants to fill the cranial cavity. Unfortunately, the waiting time for reconstruction surgery can extend to several weeks or even months, especially in less developed countries. One factor contributing to the extended waiting period is the intricate process of personalized implant modeling. Currently, the preparation of these implants by experienced biomechanical experts is both costly and time-consuming. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially in deep learning, offer promising potential for automating the process. However, deep learning-based cranial reconstruction faces several challenges: (i) the limited size of training datasets, (ii) the high resolution of the volumetric data, and (iii) significant data heterogeneity. In this work, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges by enhancing the reconstruction through learnable symmetry enforcement. We demonstrate that it is possible to train a neural network dedicated to calculating skull symmetry, which can be utilized either as an additional objective function during training or as a post-reconstruction objective during the refinement step. We quantitatively evaluate the proposed method using open SkullBreak and SkullFix datasets, and qualitatively using real clinical cases. The results indicate that the symmetry-preserving reconstruction network achieves considerably better outcomes compared to the baseline (0.94/0.94/1.31 vs 0.84/0.76/2.43 in terms of DSC, bDSC, and HD95). Moreover, the results are comparable to the best-performing methods while requiring significantly fewer computational resources (< 500 vs > 100,000 GPU hours). Moreover, its relatively low computational complexity makes it scalable for reconstructing all symmetrical structures. The article introduces an automatic skull reconstruction method based on the enforcement of skull symmetry using a learnable deep learning network. The method requires significantly fewer computational resources compared to other well-performing methods and is able to improve the reconstruction for the out-of-distribution cases. The proposed method is a considerable contribution to the field of applied artificial intelligence in medicine and is a step towards automatic cranial defect reconstruction in clinical practice.",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,2025

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and standardization in skeletal maturity assessment. Methods This study evaluates the application of AI in pediatric bone age prediction using the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) 2017 Pediatric Bone Age Challenge dataset. A deep learning model based on the ResNet-50 architecture (Microsoft Research, Redmond, Washington, USA) was developed and trained on 12,611 hand and wrist radiographs, validated on 1,425 images, and tested on 200 images. Model performance was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R²). Results The AI model achieved an RMSE of 11.07 months, an MAE of 8.54 months, and an R² of 0.929, indicating strong alignment with radiologist-determined bone ages. The Pearson correlation coefficient (0.963) and Spearman's rank correlation (0.955) confirmed the model's predictive robustness. Compared to traditional methods, which have reported variability with errors ranging from 6 to 18 months, the AI model demonstrated a reduction in inter-operator variability and improved reliability. Conclusion The implementation of AI in bone age assessment offers a more standardized, rapid, and precise alternative to conventional methods.

This scoping review aims to underline the current state-of-the-art research using combined imaging modalities. <b>Methods</b>: We searched the PubMed database using the term virtopsy for articles that are available in free full text, indexed in the Medline Database, and published in English. The query returned 49 articles on this subject that have been published since 2002. <b>Results</b>: The main imaging modalities used for postmortem imaging were computed tomography (PMCT), angiography (PMCTA), magnetic resonance imaging (PMMRI), and ultrasonography (PMUS). PMCT is highly effective for detecting complex osseous injuries, tracing bullet trajectories, or identifying characteristic findings in drowning cases. PMCTA is valuable for evaluating vascular lesions, particularly in natural death cases. PMMRI is superior in analyzing soft tissues, including brain and spinal structures, cerebrospinal fluid, microbleeds, and laryngohyoid lesions, and identifying cardiomyopathies in young individuals. PMUS serves as an alternative, and its portability also allows for use in forensic settings. One specific situation observed was the increased number of studies published about virtopsy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Another aspect is the increased focus on this alternative to conventional autopsy in the regions where maneuvering of the deceased is limited according to cultural and social customs. <b>Conclusions</b>: We underline the advantages and limitations of each imaging modality used for virtopsy. Further studies need to be developed in order to gather supplementary data regarding the use of these imaging modalities in the new era of artificial intelligence in medicine.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025

39881303,Assessing the disconnect between student interest and education in artificial intelligence in medicine in Saudi Arabia.,"Although artificial intelligence (AI) has gained increasing attention for its potential future impact on clinical practice, medical education has struggled to stay ahead of the developing technology. The question of whether medical education is fully preparing trainees to adapt to potential changes from AI technology in clinical practice remains unanswered, and the influence of AI on medical students' career preferences remains unclear. Understanding the gap between students' interest in and knowledge of AI may help inform the medical curriculum structure. A total of 354 medical students were surveyed to investigate their knowledge of, exposure to, and interest in the role of AI in health care. Students were questioned about the anticipated impact of AI on medical specialties and their career preferences. Most students (65%) were interested in the role of AI in medicine, but only 23% had received formal education in AI based on reliable scientific resources. Despite their interest and willingness to learn, only 20.1% of students reported that their school offered resources enabling them to explore the use of AI in medicine. They relied mainly on informal information sources, including social media, and few students understood fundamental AI concepts or could cite clinically relevant AI research. Students who cited more scientific primary sources (rather than online media) exhibited significantly higher self-reported understanding of AI concepts in the context of medicine. Interestingly, students who had received more exposure to AI courses reported higher levels of skepticism regarding AI and were less eager to learn more about it. Radiology and pathology were perceived to be the fields most strongly affected by AI. Students reported that their overall choice of specialty was not impacted by AI. Formal AI education seems inadequate despite students' enthusiasm concerning the application of such technology in clinical practice.

39689842,Ethical Application of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Medicine.,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) may revolutionize health care, providing solutions that range from enhancing diagnostic accuracy to personalizing treatment plans. However, its rapid and largely unregulated integration into medicine raises ethical concerns related to data integrity, patient safety, and appropriate oversight. One of the primary ethical challenges lies in generative AI's potential to produce misleading or fabricated information, posing risks of misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment recommendations, which underscore the necessity for robust physician oversight. Transparency also remains a critical concern, as the closed-source nature of many large-language models prevents both patients and health care providers from understanding the reasoning behind AI-generated outputs, potentially eroding trust. The lack of regulatory approval for AI as a medical device, combined with concerns around the security of patient-derived data and AI-generated synthetic data, further complicates its safe integration into clinical workflows. Furthermore, synthetic datasets generated by AI, although valuable for augmenting research in areas with scarce data, complicate questions of data ownership, patient consent, and scientific validity. In addition, generative AI's ability to streamline administrative tasks risks depersonalizing care, further distancing providers from patients. These challenges compound the deeper issues plaguing the health care system, including the emphasis of volume and speed over value and expertise. The use of generative AI in medicine brings about mass scaling of synthetic information, thereby necessitating careful adoption to protect patient care and medical advancement. Given these considerations, generative AI applications warrant regulatory and critical scrutiny. Key starting points include establishing strict standards for data security and transparency, implementing oversight akin to institutional review boards to govern data usage, and developing interdisciplinary guidelines that involve developers, clinicians, and ethicists.

Additionally, we highlight our most important generative AI ethics and equity considerations for these stakeholders. For clinicians, we recommend approaching generative AI similarly to other important biomedical advancements, critically appraising its evidence and utility and incorporating it thoughtfully into practice. For technologists developing generative AI for healthcare applications, we recommend a major frameshift in thinking away from the expectation that clinicians will ""supervise"" generative AI. Rather, these organizations and individuals should hold themselves and their technologies to the same set of high standards expected of the clinical workforce and strive to design high-performing, well-studied tools that improve care and foster the therapeutic relationship, not simply those that improve efficiency or market share. We further recommend deep and ongoing partnerships with clinicians and patients as necessary collaborators in this work. And for healthcare organizations, we recommend pursuing a combination of both incremental and transformative change with generative AI, directing resources toward both endeavors, and avoiding the urge to rapidly displace the human clinical workforce with generative AI. We affirm that the practice of medicine remains a fundamentally human endeavor which should be enhanced by technology, not displaced by it.",Journal of general internal medicine,2025
39523288,Focusing a Bioethics Lens on the Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Neurosurgery.,"The rapid pace of development and application of digital technology and data science, including artificial intelligence (AI), is transforming our world. In this chapter, we address the question: ""Is bioethics relevant to how we should develop, govern, and use AI in healthcare, specifically in neurosurgery?"" We recognize that medical decision-making involves uncertainty and is complex, and predicting potential outcomes is difficult. We conclude that the use of AI in neurosurgery is not inherently unethical. Hence, the ethical question becomes: Do its benefits and potential benefits in neurosurgery outweigh its risks and harms, and what safeguards are needed to ensure this? Requiring and obtaining patients' valid informed consent is important, but what such consent requires is debatable. Earning and maintaining the trust of everyone involved, especially patients and clinicians, is also essential. We recommend that to ensure the ethical development and use of AI, neurosurgeons approach its use with knowledge of both the science of AI and applied ethics and employ moral humility and moral courage in their decision-making.",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2024

This study evaluates how prompt engineering and confidence thresholds can improve diagnostic accuracy in neuroradiology. We analyze 751 neuroradiology cases from the American Journal of Neuroradiology using GPT-4 Turbo with customized prompts to improve diagnostic precision. Initially, GPT-4 Turbo achieved a baseline diagnostic accuracy of 55.1%. By reformatting responses to list five diagnostic candidates and applying a 90% confidence threshold, the highest precision of the diagnosis increased to 72.9%, with the candidate list providing the correct diagnosis at 85.9%, reducing the misdiagnosis rate to 14.1%. However, this threshold reduced the number of cases that responded. Strategic prompt engineering and high confidence thresholds significantly reduce misdiagnoses and improve the precision of the LLM diagnostic in neuroradiology.

38996696,Can physician judgment enhance model trustworthiness? A case study on predicting pathological lymph nodes in rectal cancer.,"Explainability is key to enhancing the trustworthiness of artificial intelligence in medicine. However, there exists a significant gap between physicians' expectations for model explainability and the actual behavior of these models. This gap arises from the absence of a consensus on a physician-centered evaluation framework, which is needed to quantitatively assess the practical benefits that effective explainability should offer practitioners. Here, we hypothesize that superior attention maps, as a mechanism of model explanation, should align with the information that physicians focus on, potentially reducing prediction uncertainty and increasing model reliability. We employed a multimodal transformer to predict lymph node metastasis of rectal cancer using clinical data and magnetic resonance imaging. We explored how well attention maps, visualized through a state-of-the-art technique, can achieve agreement with physician understanding. Subsequently, we compared two distinct approaches for estimating uncertainty: a standalone estimation using only the variance of prediction probability, and a human-in-the-loop estimation that considers both the variance of prediction probability and the quantified agreement. Our findings revealed no significant advantage of the human-in-the-loop approach over the standalone one. In conclusion, this case study did not confirm the anticipated benefit of the explanation in enhancing model reliability. Superficial explanations could do more harm than good by misleading physicians into relying on uncertain predictions, suggesting that the current state of attention mechanisms should not be overestimated in the context of model explainability.",Artificial intelligence in medicine,2024

With the emergence of artificial intelligence in medicine, data abstraction may be associated with reduced costs but increased efficiency and accuracy of cancer staging. To evaluate an algorithm using an artificial intelligence engine capable of extracting essential information from medical records of patients with oropharyngeal cancer and assigning tumor, nodal, and metastatic stages according to American Joint Committee on Cancer eighth edition guidelines. This retrospective diagnostic study was conducted among a convenience sample of 806 patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Medical records of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas who presented to a single tertiary care center between January 1, 2010, and August 1, 2020, were reviewed. A ground truth cancer stage dataset and comprehensive staging rule book consisting of 135 rules encompassing p16 status, tumor, and nodal and metastatic stage were developed. Subsequently, 4 distinct models were trained: model T (entity relationship extraction) for anatomical location and invasion state, model S (numerical extraction) for lesion size, model M (sequential classification) for metastasis detection, and a p16 model for p16 status. For validation, results were compared against ground truth established by expert reviewers, and accuracy was reported. Data were analyzed from March to November 2023. The accuracy of algorithm cancer stages was compared with ground truth. Among 806 patients with oropharyngeal cancer (mean [SD] age, 63.6 [10.6] years; 651 males [80.8%]), 421 patients (52.2%) were positive for human papillomavirus. The artificial intelligence engine achieved accuracies of 55.9% (95% CI, 52.5%-59.3%) for tumor, 56.0% (95% CI, 52.5%-59.4%) for nodal, and 87.6% (95% CI, 85.1%-89.7%) for metastatic stages and 92.1% (95% CI, 88.5%-94.6%) for p16 status.
